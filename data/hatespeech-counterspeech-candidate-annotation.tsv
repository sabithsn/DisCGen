1	Because men enjoy trafficking and rape. And men are the police.	This. Exactly this. They don't give a fuck about women.	0
1	What evidence do you have that male circumcision is harmful?	I was harmed by having part of an appendage hacked off without any choice in the mater.            And /u/0IIIIII if that's not harmful can I hack something off your body??	0
1	Now THESE are some good females who know their right places!	So you’re just a misogynist?	1
1	You have no idea how many things are viewed as ok when done by women but not by men.Way more.	No there's not lol   But I really don't want to enter this discussion, I know you won't change your mind and I won't change mine either. Goodnight.	1
1	I don’t doubt it  There’s just a lot of overlap with women’s subreddits as well   https://subredditstats.com/subreddit-user-overlaps/menslib	lol half of them are women subs	0
1	But judge telling ted bandy would be a great lawyer was so right afteer killing women, right?	wut ?	0
1	This is what Feminists want our society to become. Kill men and children (especially boys) while they get a pat on the back.	...What?	0
1	Then you agree with something that contradicts your OP. There are literally more vanity item accessories for women than men actively worn on average.	You might be right. Sometimes I say stuff purely to hear an opposition. When I can't think of an opposing view, I ask Reddit.	0
1	Feminism according to the Cambridge dictionary (though you could pick any one and they'd say more or less the same thing): the belief that women should be allowed the same rights, power, and opportunities as men 	You're confused as to the nature of a dictionary.	0
1	And let's not forget about the scrote from Mulan...the one who left her for dead in the snow after he discovered she was a woman...for some reason this doesn't get talked about enough	His gift to her was not *actively* k!ll!ng her after she saved all their asses.	0
1	I've heard of this happening to SO many women. Never let him pursue his dream first, always you. What a shame about your friend. Too bad it's so predictable. We're rooting for her	Totally because men are quick to switch up on you and women are left to pick up the pieces. Always pursue  your goals and dreams. You’re an individual first before you are a wife/fiancée/girlfriend.	0
1	women use their tears as a weapon.	I strongly believe men are increasingly becoming aware of it and stopped giving a shyt about their tears.	0
1	Well, it makes sense  Atleast it's better than our feminist's #killallmen	I’m not a feminist - I’m a humanist.	0
1	Why would women want to be like the one on the right though? Like who in their right mind want to be a financially dependent SAHM?   I'm an anti feminist woman and I don't really resonate with or want to be either. Both these stereotypes suck imo.	Because women in general are happier and more fulfilled when they perform home duties and raise a family with a loving husband who cares for and provides for them.	1
1	That’s an incredibly click baity photo to use for this article. I think the odds of a woman who looks like that picking me up in her Uber vehicle are about as good as Scarlett Johansson randomly showing up at my doorstep in her underwear.	To be fair, the creator of the video does want you to click it.	0
1	Yet they expect men to work in the sewer line.	That’s the bottom line. All that talk but they still need men.	0
1	I think women should return to homemaking. I think they are better suited for that than whatever they are doing at work.	They should just make gyms where men and women and trans and everyone can join.... but you.	0
1	I suppose there's no harm in giving men equal access to abortion.	It's nice to find someone who also supports the elimination of the "child" support slavery system.	0
1	I'd like to thank this feminist for admitting their ONLY problem with oppressive systems of power is who controls them.	Who they perceive as controlling them	0
1	To be fair, various bills have been introduced where women would be drafted alongside men, in the United States. None have passed but there is support among men and women for that kind of thing	Just like there is support for splitting the bill 50/50. Doesn't make it better imo, but maybe that's just me. It's really not the gotcha they think it is.	0
1	While I would absolutely love to have her removed and can’t wait until I no longer see daily news reports about her.  Surely it’s anti democratic to do such a thing? The voters vote for her because they want her in power?	The Senate and the Electoral College are also anti-democratic, but they are a part of our system	0
1	Sure, and a man has the power to completely destroy a woman's life through rape, and she can almost never prove it. People suck.	A woman also has the power to completely destroy a man’s life through rape, and he can prove that even less. People do suck, and this post is about a problem that can be fixed, that effects men. Do you realize what sub this is?	1
1	Great, so then you are ok with the laws against abortion. Then what are you arguing? If it is ok to pass a law and charge a woman with murder for an abortion, then what is your argument?   Are women being put in cages and forced to carry their babies?	I was agreeing with you by pointing out the absurdity of OPs claim. I think abortion is necessary, just find OPs take on it as wrong.	0
1	At least that violent man will never abuse a woman again. Be safe, OP	I’m trying to remind myself of this often.	0
1	Male 20s, feminist #sexworkiswork, need a 50/50 partner not these gold digging hoes, need a independent woman to be my mom and husband. Profile quote: "If you wanna be treated like a queen better treat me like a king. 🙄🙄🤡🤡🤮🤮🤮	>need a independent woman to be my mom and husband.  i am DYING!!!!!!!	0
1	&gt;now this bitch  Sounds like you want a punching bag - probably go find that and take your anger/aggressions out there, and leave the woman alone.	Seriously, OP, you have a chip on your shoulder big enough to land a plane. You should work on that. We were all young and stupid in high school.	0
1	https://www.reddit.com/r/MensRights/comments/bo36do/woman_who_only_got_250_fine_for_drunkenly/	Well shit, I guess it had been posted here when it happened.. I only just stumbled acrossed it.. pretty sad that shit like this is only seeming to happen more and more, and with equally upsetting "consequences"	0
1	Wanna bet he doesn't do his share of helping out with chores and the baby and is then surprised that his exhausted, sleep deprived wife isn't interested in being his human fleshlight (because let's face it: an orgasm for her is not in the cards here)?	No orgasm and a chance to risk a second pregnancy and go through all that shit again?  I wouldn't be interested either.	0
1	And how exactly is that last part support to not illustrate a simple glowing hate for women?	How does it?	0
1	Okay so what about my statement is wrong then? I just said that if guys wanted men to be paid more, then they should support male creators	I think OP is pointing out that Feminists dont seem to fight for "Equality" when the Equality would either benefit Men or negatively impact Women. This is just an example of that...	0
1	If a woman lead and the man followed, what would make that wrong to you?	It would go against natural law.	0
1	Don't bother with the baby and run away.   It is not like men have any reproductive rights, so you can't do anything if she doesn't want you to get involved.	that doesn't seem kinda fucked up to you though? i would think i at least have a right to know if the baby even is mine cause at least then i might be able to help take care of her (the baby).	0
1	because they're losing control over the one thing that they have agency over, sex and relationships. if men are outsourcing sex from more traditionally feminine countries, they no longer need to put up with the feminist drivel of their native women.	And that's why feminist are so hell bent on "abolishing" prostitution.	0
1	No because abortion is murder	She can still do it	0
1	In Western nations men choose to work more dangerous jobs. There are plenty of safe jobs available but they don't want them. Please allow men to be responsible for their choices.	Men don’t choose those jobs. There is active discrimination in college and hiring practices that prevent men from taking less dangerous jobs. Very few little boys grew up writing “oil rig grunt” on their career dreams homework.	0
1	Lol, said by a man that does not understand women.  🤣	Go back to the kitchen.	0
1	Incels are feminist? I don’t think you’ve had the pleasure of talking with them before.	wait doesn't incel mean someone who is a virgin involuntarily?	0
1	It’s the truth. You can go back into my comment thread and see how many men I have had “discussions” with and see how they react. I get called a feminist and a man hater.   Can’t have it both ways.	> Can’t have it both ways.  Can't have what both ways?	0
1	Yea. The whole "forcing men to say while letting women leave" shifted my view from "LETTS GOO UKRAINE ALL THE WAY" to just "I hope ukraine wins"	Thank you. Exactly how i feel.	0
1	Not only that, but I assume even if she's a woman, she could be fishing for her boyfriend or luring me into a trap to get raped.  It scares me that so many women I know *still* don't insist on public meetings and will just go to stranger's houses.	YES THIS.  Most "bi" women are only trying to appease their pornsick bfs for a threeway. It usually starts as "can he just watch? He won't touch you"... like that's not creepy AF.	0
1	Men don’t WANT to make home furnishing or vacation decisions, what a joke. You are reframing a burden on women as power. Utterly ridiculous.	>Men don’t WANT to make home furnishing or vacation decisions, what a joke.   Sexist bigot. Change.	0
1	Pretty ironic coming from a feminist's mouth.	I'm a feminist?	0
1	Not all feminists hate, but those who do hate men.   Feminists is such a big term and it covers all kind of communities from inclusive feminists all the way to men hating/transphobe/racist feminists.	I agree with you, I just found it funny	0
1	Men's liberation doesn't come from the defamation of women.	Unless it suits us at the moment. Victory needs no explanation, and defeat allows none.	0
1	Dude. It was the whole Hollywood industry, not feminism.	Stop  the lies, this sub is not r/nothowgirlswork . We don't promote  lying and fantasy. Stick to facts and logic please.	0
1	This is fucking gross. As a man I've worked with women that "grew into adulthood" and I still see them as children. If he has romantic feelings for her now he must have felt that way when she was 14. Her dad should me mortified.	I’m 27 and I was thinking about the fact that this guy was 14 this girl was a baby! I find that so gross! I never liked that Monica from Friends dated her dad’s friend Richard even if she was an adult. He knew her as a child!	0
1	How... what are the buzz words again? Stunning and brave.   At least she's rightfully getting called out in the comments and downvoted.	Exactly, and the victim mentality is strong with this one	0
1	The fact that women can't succeed in STEM fields despite attending the exact same school system, shows that women are inadequate and worth less than men	The fact that women can't hold marriages together to divorce 70% of the time despite being in the exact same relationship as their husband...	0
1	I love how it's "men shouldn't feel bad for acting how our garbage culture trains them to act" instead of "hey, lets all defeat toxic masculinity"	Well they don't think it's real, while never questioning why they cant cry or hug their friends	0
1	You agree with a woman's right but you think too many are doing it.	There are lots of things you have the right to do that you shouldn't. Bugchasing, actively trying to make other people miserable while staying just within the law, using ad hominem arguments.	0
1	Aight find me one mainstream feminist source that says it's ok for women to cheat. I'll wait. And no randos on Twitter with a #killallmen	WAP is female empowerment	0
1	Men get conscripted into war - a tale as old as time. Are you shocked?	Just because it's a tale as old as time doesn't make it righteous. Because women were excluded from power and equal legal rights for almost all of human history doesn't make that morally right.	1
1	Yeah feminist comedians shouldn't make fun of men	This I disagree with as you should be able to make jokes on anything and anyone. Of course it actually has to be funny or it sounds like a stupid rant as shown above	1
1	If she’s considered sexy than good luck Russia	[This is the translator](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/putin-interpreter-a.jpg). Her name is [Daria Boyarskaya](https://nypost.com/2021/09/29/get-to-know-the-stunning-russian-translator-putin-brought-to-trump-meeting/).	0
1	The problem is too many men being emotional bitches. My opinion. I remember men being men in the 90’s early mid 2000’s. Now shits weird.   Emotions and being emotional, totally different	Being emotional means you're in-touch with your emotions, and men are barely allowed to even show emotions	1
1	Saying you aren't against women's rights but you're against feminism doesn't make any sense.	I believe women should have equal rights to men. I ALSO believe men should have equal rights to women. That second part is inherently anti-feminist.	1
1	First you start by saying it's a fact and by the end you're just rambling about how unfair women are.  This post had so much potential but you just chose to mald about women instead, sad.	Indeed, smells like incel in here	0
1	Every woman i know	That's an interesting observation. Maybe its just you that's trash.	1
1	Isn't it fucked up that men literally don't know what a woman's body looks like if she doesn't remove hair? I showed my family my armpit hair and they were flabbergasted. It's so infuriating	I don't like armpit hair on my own(male) body. I don't like it for looks and for hygiene (tend to sweat less when it's short). I think everyone(all genders) should shave it for hygienic purposes, but  your body is nobody's business	1
1	Donna Hylton, who was defended by feminists, and complained that she was treated too harshly on a gender basis.	Not enough is discussed or written about feminism and it’s connection to violence.	0
1	It's like you just discovered feminism, this shit has been happening for decades and still nobody bats an eye because propaganda is aimed to keep victimizing the peivileged ones.	I need that last statement on a t shirt	0
1	Yeah, I loved the part that said "...or identifies as a woman". Like, it seems like a pretty dumb loophole. "Tom, we need you to wear makeup in public and say you're female. We'll give you double your quarterly bonuses."	I'm sure there was a week when a whole bunch of married California directors came out as (monogamously) bisexual.	0
1	If you shoot someone and are a feminist, you're an antifeminst hero	The rad-fem crowd is notorious for having total psychopaths giving keynote speeches at their rallies.   Nothing "anti" about it. They literally hold such criminals up on a pedestal.	0
1	So we are back to how you want to ignore the male victims and instead just bitch about females.  Cool.   Glad we cleared up how little about men your supposed ideal care.	You hate to hear it, but we support male victims and stand against female privilege. Cry, whine and bark about it. Fuck female privileges🦋	1
1	Men getting triggered over women? Yes, indeed very popular.	Meh! Enjoy your cats. Luckily I'm bi so I don't have to put up with being alone or with women	0
1	Oh sorry my friend, did not know you were the female hive mind. Excuse me, for you have beaten me	Women find men creepy. They will never stop being creeped out by men. And men will never stop being creepy—how could they? Therefore, the sexes must be separated in public.	0
1	Lol banned.    Bro toxic masculinity doesn’t exist, don’t give credit to their paradigm.	Kinda does, but it's more that some people use masculine traits in a toxic way.	0
1	Don't be naive. They get it, they just pretend not to in order to hate on men.	As a 100% middle eastern who's a man and half black, screw these stupid mindless man-hating racists	0
1	So many women are getting flairs here obviously without reading the handbook.	Safer taking the bus ffs	0
1	Men are not told how unattractive they are enough in society in general. I totally agree women need to be more vocal about it.	Critique every stupid thing about their appearance like they do to women.	0
1	I feel like we live in a really sad world if we need analogies of guns to explain why women need to be careful.	We **do** live in a sad world. It’s a shithole.	0
1	I think the worst feminists trying to sell is "sex workers are r*pe victims" 🤷🏻‍♀️	This is exactly what stood out to me as well.	0
1	Okay good, non rabid feminists are based then.	There are no non-rabid feminists.	0
1	My goodness. Seems a lot has happened since I put my dancing shoes away 10 years ago. Or is this only the new kids? This 40 year old retired slut doesn’t remember this being a thing when I was out and about 2000-2015…	As a fellow retired slut, the spitting was getting out of control, no… I would prefer NOT to lick your asshole and I should not have bruises after sex that last weeks. Calm down boys, I was just trying to Catch a dick.	0
1	About 77 women tweeted #KillAllMen and people have been complaining about it ever since to feel victimized by it.  It's really nothing to pay attention to.	THANK YOU	0
1	It has a lot to do with him, and every other man who is trashed for their single mistake while women are shrugged off for their many mistakes	James Franco didnt make a "single mistake". He tried to do the diddly doo with a minor.	0
1	Banning women from the internet would objectively improve society	Idk about that one dawg	0
1	Are you suggesting some kind if affirmative action where men with less qualifications get into colleges easier? Men are less than 40 percent of applicants so to get it to 50/50 you would need to lower standards for men.	Assuming the least charitable interpretation to generate a strawman for you to defeat. Checks out.	0
1	Women have no accountability	Generalization	1
1	well as grown adults we know this. But especially young women see a ton of thirsty men in their comments. and yeah they do look perfect if you dont know any better.	Maybe one day we'll come full circle and women will look like those fat Venus figurines from ancient Mesopotamia	0
1	Of course! Here’s the source of my research and observations!  r/antifeminists	Damn🥵🥵 hot roast	0
1	men nowadays are so brainwashed by feminists to the point where anything that isn't affecting women directly is a non-issue to them	The structure of the education system is designed to benefit the man who is able to feminize himself the most	0
1	It's plain and simple misogyny. They're showing us in action that they think women are sub-human.  They don't apply the same standard to themselves. It's like they've never seen a dick or a man in the nude. They're hairy and ugly AF.	You literally just did the same thing and think it’s ok 😂	1
1	Lol. I don’t know if you guys remember. But two or three years ago. These females were freaking out because of the sex robots were getting too realistic.	As far as I know people are still freaking out about that. Obviously a robot can't replace a woman, not yet anyway..👀	0
1	if I had a buck for every time a woman on this sub has commented / complained / ranted / vented about this very subject I'd have about fifteen bucks. Great idea for an ad.	fifteen? I'd have twenty just from this thread!	0
1	OK. So given that what I've just said is true, what makes you say women?	Job opportunity wise.. sexism.. maybe not respected as quickly..stuff of that sort	0
1	I just learned that spinster was a term used for women weavers who made so much money at their job they didn't need to get married	Yes!   And wasn't Sleeping Beauty cursed to prick her finger on a spindle? And forced to sleep until a man kissed her without consent? The story of "jealous" Maleficent too?	0
1	Women were never funny.	do you like, speak to other human beings?	0
1	She's the reason why people say "women aren't funny"	I can't disagree 😭	0
1	No it is the false rape accusations capital of the world...    There is a link above which shows 53% cases are false (global average is 2% according to feminists).  That should give in you an idea of the 'real problem'.	this is fax.	0
1	Get a right revoked is not the direction we should go for man...  Getting a level playfield is about getting our rights, the fucking name of the sub is men rights not "taking rights of women "	This right here. Thank you.	0
1	People in this sub are physically incapable of detecting sarcasm. Men's rights are doomed.	It was doomed when they banned the incel sub.	0
1	imagine wanting to manipulate the tragic and untimely death of children because of an unfortunate circumstance to fit your narrative of "double standards"      may this be feminism or any other group of people attempting this, it is fucking disgusting	100%!!  Imagine taking an agenda that is totally self-serving like theirs, and making children’s deaths all about hating MEN…even when we are talking about a mass shooting by a KID who barely was 18 at the time!!	0
1	It's a specialised term belonging to feminist ideology. It means whatever they want it to mean.   I wouldn't bother thinking much further than that.	Everyone glances at Everyone on the street. The end.	0
1	This is one of the most obvious trolls on here. I mean you name is womanmcwomanface	Lmao are people here mentally retarded? Did they actually think I was serious that they downvoted me lol. I will choose to believe that they just didn't like my sense of humor.	0
1	Reminds me of the crazy stats of men leaving their female partners very quickly after a cancer diagnosis.	Source: trust me bro?	0
1	this woman finds a man funny, she must want to fellate them.  Your insults are lame bro. Try harder.	Lmfao what	0
1	[Here it is ](https://nypost.com/2018/10/04/academic-journal-accepts-feminist-mein-kampf/amp/)	Jesus!	0
1	Women are mentally children.	This comment is unacceptable, please delete it	1
1	They wouldn't talk to their bros like that, would they? Of course not, because they are misogynistic pos, and women, in their book, are never right. It seems like you know your worth, so I'm not sure why do you tolerate disrespect from your current bf.	This - they can control it at work, with their friend and with their family. But ‘lose control’ on the women that they find to be acceptable targets. It’s a total sham.	0
1	This is despite the fact that men are the vast majority of street assault victims	Whenever anything bad happens to a man, the woman who is relying on that man's resources is the REAL victim.	0
1	Goodness me... I guess, that means to feminists I must "hate" my own gender? Lol, what...	Internalised misogyny apparently.	0
1	There’s a woman in my life like this. We stopped talking about a month ago, &amp; I’ve been thinking of hitting her up again recently. Now I’m not so sure. Maybe, it’s for the best.	Life's too short to date a feminist.	0
1	How are western women oppressed exactly? They have all the privileges you can think of.	all around the fucking world' reading is important :) most people fighting for women's rights care about... the oppression of women. and that, fortunately for you, extends much further than the limitations of western culture	0
1	just saying it's probably not right to test someone out like that the first time around most extreme feminists will be the ones questioning you in my experience	It's a guide for newbies. Or people who need them. I replied to someone else above.  Men with experience won't need to ask questions. They can tell.	0
1	Don’t. I was coerced on those apps and the number of stories I hear about women experiencing sexual trauma from these apps is heartbreaking. Don’t do it.	This! I also suffered abuse while on the apps and was subjected to sexual harassment almost daily. I just don’t understand why women continue to put themselves through it. If it happened to one women, it’ll happen to you. No ones an exception	0
1	Red pill had multiple top posts about taking away women’s working rights. MGTOW produced 2 shooters who killed and targeted women.	>Red pill had multiple top posts about taking away women’s working rights.  Evidence?  >MGTOW produced 2 shooters who killed and targeted women.  EVIDENCE?!?!??!	0
1	Feminism isn't about promiscuity. It's about choice. Do you think women should be oppressed and forced into a specific way of life?	I think a woman should dress whatever way she wishes. But if she claims to be Muslim (to submit one's will to God), she should dress in a way that God approves of.	0
1	Yes, women can be bitches do  But feminism isn't about encouraging this type of behavior.	Feminists are fighting to get rid of ALL this stuff! - "Feminists 'aren't about encouraging' THAT."	0
1	Men who don't have sexual discipline or decorum, is equivalent to a man who pees involuntarily or still wets the bed at 37.  It's not the flex that you think it is. 🙄	There are dogs with way more self control.	0
1	Does the lady  have a education ? Never heard of this woman .. only social platform I use is Reddit and that is for crypto . But this popped up . Looks like someone’s grandma that had a hard life .	Do you always ask whether a candidate has an education?	1
1	if anything, i feel like i see men body shaming women a lot more. a girl with a few rolls on tik tok would probably be called a land whale by some edgy teen boy	you live in a different universe then🤷🏽	0
1	Most women want and expect a man to be a provider. Not all, but most.	We don’t, you’re mixing up most women with gold diggers, incel alert	1
1	How does this have anything to do with feminism?	Feminist would call her an empowered woman with a within normal weight and body positivity. Reality calls her a delusional fat nutcase.	0
1	Anyone willing to place a bet that she will get any sort of meaningful punishment?  Any takers?	LOL, White women don't get punished in the criminal justice system.	0
1	I can't remember which feminist said "when you're accustomed to privilege, equality feels like oppression"	Because originally it was an MRA on Usenet describing a woman.  https://www.quoteinvestigator.com/2016/10/24/privilege/	0
1	Girls just wanna have fun	Usual romance male love interest with their "emotional depth" usually is a crybaby doormat that acts with simplistic reactions like a dog.	0
1	&gt;but they like men who identify as women and women who identify as men.   Do they? Isn't there a trasphobic element to some feminists? "Terfs"	Yea feminists are so backwards   Can’t even agree on the same ideology lol that’s why we have SWERFS and TERFS	0
1	Why can't a woman work at this job?    Do women categorically refuse to work under dangerous conditions?	I don't blame anyone for not wanting to work where this guy works.	0
1	Obviously because men actually have all the power and rule the world /s	As an antifeminist, with no inferiority complex, I completely accepted that. F-movement followers don't assume that leaders in power are happy to be supported by loving and nurturing partners.	0
1	I don't get why you post it here, because here feminism and feminists are getting a slap, not women as a whole.	It is a jab at the sub but what can we do 🤷‍♂️	0
1	https://www.change.org/p/brisbane-courts-increase-the-punishment-for-woman-who-stabbed-man-with-stiletto	Signed!	0
1	So women don't enjoy and pursue sex? A woman who wants to have sex with a man doesn't need his permission or consent?	They do, but they don't have to pursue very hard. They have more opportunities and they have their pick.	0
1	Apparently all male commenters get banned automatically from that sub.	what if someone's female and they just assume they're male?  or if someone's trans?  oop, being anti lgbtq wouldn't be a good luck for them	0
1	DNA testing should be something we do for children. It helps to eliminate paternal fraud and it’s helps to detect potential genetic illnesses. Why would any women oppose this? Unless they cheated on their husbands or plan to cheat on them.	>Why would any women oppose this?  Some may consider it a government overreach.	1
1	But there were quite a few who were[irradiated](https://www.britannica.com/story/radium-girls-the-women-who-fought-for-their-lives-in-a-killer-workplace)	Factories have always been dangeorus for everyone who was working in them.	0
1	How do you figure that women don’t have equal rights in voting? They are allowed to vote in every election. I agree with you about the draft and selective service in the United States. Women need to be a part of that if they truly want to be equal.	Men have to sign up for the draft to be able to vote. Women do not.  Therefore not equal.	0
1	Women are a minority? Wtf	I'm pretty sure there at emore women in the world than men. At leas that's what it seems like.	0
1	If you're a woman, pretend to be a man when playing multi-player online to prevent having a breakdown	I sometimes pretend to be a woman because desperate men will just give me free stuff.	0
1	men are clearly doing better because they die more?	I was not referring to that point.	0
1	... and yet #AllMenAreRapists and #KillAllMen  And ofc most feminists didn't have an objection to that, they even encourage it.  Buuuut i guess it's only an issue when men do it. Oh well.	It’s clearly not genuine. Get a grip.	1
1	Tractor Supply has women's work gloves! I just found them last week after a whole season sliding around in gigantic work gloves.	I don’t know why I didn’t think of this. There’s one on my way home from work. Thanks for the suggestion!’	0
1	Except it does mean women don't want to be treated that way in the first place no? So why force the majority to be treated in a way they don't like you know what I'm saying?	Yes that's exactly what I mean!! Men shouldn't be treated the way they are, with the "no emotions" bs and all that, with the rough housing and the "that's just how boys are" bs. No one should be treated like that	0
1	The amount of times I've heard that one. 'FeMiNiSm Is FoR mEn ToO'. No thanks. I'd rather not be part of a movement that hates my very existence	It's one of the giveaways that (as I keep saying), feminists are about control.  If they weren't, they'd let us be to solve our own problems;  but no, they have to be the ones to do it for us.	0
1	20 attractive young non-feminist women... that's more than all of Tinder. For someone who's entrepreneurial, these 20 women, if they're available and they want to, are the nexus of a new dating site that actually has a shot at succeeding!	Yeah man open up a "antifeminist women" only dating site, atleast then we will know who is a feminist and who is not lol, and also no more social barriers (that feminists put upon us, like having money and badass body structures and what not)	0
1	Women pay child support, too.	How does that change my point? Courts still shouldn’t do child support	0
1	Feminism was made to make men feel less, but i assure that the opposite of feminism, antifeminism, does not condemn women, instead you are some of the sensible people out there, and I wish the very best for your life :)	Thank you for your kind words. I just wish it was enough to change the way things are for men around the world.	0
1	No, she's supposed to try to smile or at least not be a sour puss because that's what salespeople are supposed to do. It has nothing to do with her being a girl.	Oh dear, then have them all….	0
1	I wouldn't watch past the TRAILER. These women were so easily manipulated I am very tempted to victim blame.	It's really good. It shows you how it went from tinder to craziness.	0
1	I'm not ashamed of any kinks except for my fetish for women wearing glasses. Thxs scooby doo.	It wasn’t a weird fetish till the scooby doo thing.	0
1	Exactly. Women always use that excuse. Or other mental health issues.	It's not technically an excuse, postpartum depression is real and common but if that's the case we should be doing more to protect the kids from the mothers during the (usually) short bouts of it.	0
1	Second by the “dumped her for a younger woman”, woman don’t bite that bait anymore. Her reply was perfect!	Lol no woman of any age wants a loser who gambles all of his money away. A friend of mine married a gambler and things ended very badly. He cleaned her out.	0
1	It is truly baffling how frequently misogynistic feminists are.	yeah, if you ever encounter a feminist, don't call them out on misandary, they won't care, instead call them out on their misogyny and call them a women hater	0
1	Go inside a girl.	I mean a bathroom, obviously. What did you think. You cultured man.	0
1	I got band for saying ‘your a true feminist’	Fr, I learned 1 thing today, women fighting against not FOR women, but AGAINST men, are absolutely retarded	0
1	who is saying any of that? that sounds more like a parody of feminism/90s PC stuff.	your lack of self-awareness is endearing.	1
1	I think I’m fairly clear on the MGTOW outlook toward relationships with women. What would you say is the general MGTOW outlook toward interpersonal relationships in general?	It's your own way. You have to answer that for yourself. Forget how society tells you to live and just figure out what your own way means to you. Its not about rules. It's about putting your energy into yourself.	0
1	The longer the better, only hivemind smoothbrains would legitimately feel that women have it better than men in Australian society.	It depends what you’re judging as “better”.	0
1	While some men might be told men don't cry, women are belittled for being emotional.	> While some men might be told men don't cry, women are belittled for being emotional.  Source?	0
1	Nailed it. If they want to fight and stay, good for them, they are heroes protecting their nation. But why the fuck are all men forced to stay? And like you say, why is the "progressive west" completely ignoring this?	Because that is how militaries have always functioned.  The state only functions by force and coercion.  Too many interests, male and female are served by young men being forced to fight for others.	0
1	You can tell she is seething sometimes in the stand wanting to lash out in her predictable behavior pattern.	She seems to have settled down with the lashing out, and is now just claiming to not remember anything or anyone.	0
1	Bullshit, she's trying to walk it back, and rather unsuccessfully at that. She's book smart and life stupid.	> She's book smart  There's no evidence of that either.	0
1	I stated above. His views on women are something I don't agree with.	What are his views on women?	0
1	Or MAYBE just MAYBE women should fucking register for the draft.	Why? They're literally unable to perform frontline combat duties, why the fuck would you conscript them?	0
1	Quick ! Someone post this on a feminist sub so we can see how it was a man who led on a woman to be a harrasser	Surely it's because his giant schlong was  printing through his uniform, sending her into a tizzy.  Or, "he liked it, you can't sexually harass a man"	0
1	You all seem to hate women, but I’m sure you’ve all “used them for sex”	That’s a pretty big accusation, hate is a strong word	0
1	Oh fuck off loser femtroll. Its LITERALLY stated in numerous tweets ABOVE.  Go back to your feminist sub.	God damn dawg I’m literally calling that person out for making an argument that no one was claiming, subtracting from the legit discussion we are having about a men’s right issue. In no way a troll. Big fan of this sub...	0
1	“Women have rights! The right to obey their husband, father, and church leader.” -Justice Barrett	Did she really say that??? Omg.	0
1	There are lots of girls who think their teachers are hot and “fuckable” same goes with boys, doesn’t mean you can abuse that power you have	100% agree!  Hope I didn't imply otherwise.	0
1	This doesn't affect men at all but helps women. And helping women is met with a lot of anger for some reason.	Because who's going to have to pick up the slack whilst women are taking extra paid leave?	0
1	So a woman who has her tubes tied or a hysterectomy is no longer a woman?  What a woman who has never been able to have kids because of a fertility issue?	She is still a woman seeing as BIOLOGICALLY she has the goods to carry/birth babies if said woman can untie her tubes. Also removing fertility issues, that woman is still able to carry and birth a child as well.   Why is that too hard to understand?😂	0
1	What? It's literally part of their slogans, "equal rights" or "gender equality" is the top speech of feminism	Where?	0
1	Don’t forget being scared of women having sex.	They aren't afraid of women having sex, they're upset that they aren't having sex with whoever they want, whenever they want.	0
1	Saw a creepy ass TikTok about a dude who invites women over then massages them enough that they feel relaxed and “safe.” Then gaslights them into sleeping with him. He said, “It works every time.”	that’s disgusting.	0
1	They expect men just to be plantation serfs/serviles, they want us to be 'ready to serve'.	This is where logic comes in. Men know that to get the best performance out of someone, they need time off, hobbies, and general happiness. Many women will sabotage your career then tell you to get two minimum wage jobs to make money for them.	0
1	Women have always been the primary sufferers of blah blah blah	Women are the primary victims of [Insert any event]	0
1	So the rape of a woman is more impactful than the killing of a man?	some people would deem rape worse than death, but that isn't my point.  the possibility of death with the possibility of rape is worse than only the possibility of death.	0
1	I hope you appreciate the fact that you won’t be banned like in feminist subreddits, because, guess what, this isn’t an echo chamber and we are open to discussions.	As a feminist, I appreciate that, too	0
1	Spoke to some people in industry, mostly. I also have a number of male centric hobbies and I come across this a lot so it wasn’t a huge stretch to believe in some circles it can be tough.	If that is true, that is clearly wrong and shouldn't happen.	0
1	I never thought about that as the reason why so many women turn to alternative medicine but it makes so much sense!	This is definitely why I saw a naturopath.  She sucked and sold me snake oil.  I wish I’d stuck with regular healthcare	0
1	There are currently no barriers to entry for any career, but things like women's-only scholarships for programs like engineering exist, and women are massively supported and encouraged to join those fields.	Uh there absolutely are barriers to entry for careers, you just mentioned one? (College education)  This also has nothing to do with my point: that **there’s nothing wrong with anyone, woman or man, choosing not to take a dangerous job.**	1
1	I think actual misogynists mainly live in the heads of feminists or as absurd characters on every feminist tv shows and movies that are being put out constantly lately tbh.	I blame Netflix for fanning the flames of division with its woke and all-too-controversial programming.	0
1	She was intent on being on top.  She might have had a good time, but my dick being twirled around did not.	Your own personal acrobat 😂	0
1	Men's toilet is always piss-soaked no matter what you do and where. And the ammonium smell is really freakishly strong too - perhaps because most men don't drink water much so their piss stink like hell.	It's terrible. It reminds me of cat pee as well. No wonder it's suggested men pee in the garden to keep foxes away. I don't want any man using my toilet because they can't do it properly. There's no excuse for it.	0
1	*Western women	I concur.	0
1	you accused MRA of treating all women as if they were one group; but in reality you did that which is why you equated feminism and "women" as if all women were feminists (only about 24% are in the USA)	And not to forget about 20% men are feminists too.    And most of trans people as well.     Feminism is not same as women.    There are male-feminists too.	0
1	As a 38 year old female I get this feeling, truth is to be the best friend (and in my case feminist ) you just have to support those you love with whatever choices make them happy	I can support my friends while still needing to cultivate a social life that doesn’t involve kids.	0
1	The world has gone crazy.  Feminists may become conservatives.  😂😂😂	Chappelle acknowledged this! Got attacked on stage for saying that JK Rowling is right for pointing out men can't become women and vice versa  Netflix had to can people because they couldn't handle that simple truth!	0
1	Family court alone has caused tremendous amounts damage to men, and that was changed strictly because of feminism.  Also divorce, the uptick in divorce is always almost step in toe with the rise and popularity of feminism and NOW fucking around with stuff.	The untold damage done to children thanks to western jurisprudence through feminism will be felt for decades to come.	0
1	Worst part is that she absolutely could.	Shhhh 🤫 don’t tell her that	0
1	This how I think women treat unattractive men.  I'm older and after 50 got that treatment.  The empathy gap is very real.	I thought 50 year old men were prime tho? Young tight ladies falling at your feet. Like they say women hit the wall and men stay sexy forever. Guess it’s a lie.	0
1	I’m a feminist. I’m also twice the man you are. I was wondering how you’d measure it, so I could put you in your place.	Self respect, and the ability to reason what’s really going on. Any self respecting man would think twice about aligning with those who seek to dehumanize him. I don’t even need to expand on the second point.	0
1	Thats funny that you get downvoted just for promoting actual equality on their pages.	if you go back to their pists, the other commenter got downvoted so much they deleted everything	0
1	Toxic masculinity is a product of misogyny. You did it to yourselves by valuing ablist culture over everything. This has nothing to do with women but rather how men and capitalism have shaped society.	Absolute nonsense.	1
1	Men are TWICE as likely to be murdered than women.  Men are TWICE as likely to be attacked by a stranger than women.  But that doesn't matter why?	It's about street harassment.  Bringing up something unrelated and complaining it's not included is weird.	0
1	of course, you hate women	You seem to be misogynistic for assuming TwoX represents all women? Where is your women hatred coming from?	0
1	She on that podcast calling herself a “trophy woman” 🤣	I mean…. She does have a *really* nice ass 🤷🏻‍♂️	0
1	Can't keep blaming white men for the world's problems and then expect those same men to want to be on your team.	Nowadays they’re including black men in the problem category too.	0
1	Single women live longer AND live happier than straight women married to men across the globe, but men don’t like to discuss these statistics for some reason	Yes...they're happier too!	0
1	When did I say it was an exception? Quite literally said that the entire education system is designed to help girls.	... that person did not reply to you...	0
1	Its not my biological imperative to bear and raise children. I can't nurse or give birth like a woman can.	How convenient for you.	0
1	Not sure how this is a retirement plan? The money goes to the child. Who is to even say he has money. Most of the men here seem to be jobless morons.	Read it again. It says the father should be legally obligated to support the woman and the child.	0
1	I'm obsessed with my web series pilot I'm producing.  Women are irrelevant.	I'm obsessed with men.  Women are irrelevant.	0
1	It puts them in a situation where they either do a two person job alone or they abort and risk to lose fertility.  As such doesnt stop women yeah but it will heavily push them torwards abortion. Would you want to take care of a baby absolutely alone?	No, if I became pregnant and I didn’t want to deal with that, I would get an abortion.	0
1	I’m pretty sure feminists didn’t tell men to go die in wars, that was something that the government does. Y’all are so focused on hating feminists that you fail to see the real enemy.	Ever heard of the white feather movement?  They did.They even shamed 10 year olds for not going to war.	0
1	Um. Cute clothes? That's all I can come up with. Women have cute clothes. But then there's that whole pocket thing... Ugh. I got nothing. Sorry. My bad... I'm bad at this	I appreciate the effort lol	0
1	If the Lord doesn’t see fit for the female to cum to reproduce, then I don’t either.	I pity the poor woman that somehow ends up in your bed. If the Lord made women with a clit (which only exists for sexual pleasure) then maybe you should take His hint and fucking use it lmfao	0
1	Funny how it's always men that get to be considered as undeserving of their kids.	Sure buddy, whatever you say...  Can I get back to the conversation with the grownups now?	1
1	male escorts throughout DC sharing stories that Lady Graham likes to get railed by strong men and that his booty is covered in moles which he calls his "ladybugs"	What a terrible day to have eyes	0
1	Because you bring it up as an alternative to abortion? How could it be an alternative, if it’s centuries away?	i bring it up as a hypothetical. their issue is killing the fetus. okay, so what if we had abortion where the fetus survives? would they be willing to pay for it? because i wouldn’t be.	0
1	Also women: "why don't men ask us out anymore?"	Give people what they want.	0
1	So I can deal with the question - you just dislike the answer.   Men have no say in abortion because pregnancy is a gendered event, and the consequences of a pregnancy, whether it’s continued or not, disproportionally fall on women.	Because women get pregnant by themselves.	0
1	aren’t there equal numbers of men and women? how do women have more power in a majority vote?	i said country wise for a reason. for example:  As of July 1, 2020, there were 162.26 million males and 167.23 million females living in the United States.  5 million is notable in voting power IMO.	0
1	Last option. Social media like this are feminist as fuck. This also can be banned anytime	Ah yeah, banning men’s safe spaces but keeping women’s safe spaces, sounds very equal	0
1	The top text is acting like it’s all men’s fault	If you want promiscuity to stop, then men have to stop too. If men didn’t sleep around, neither would women. It’s the same vise versa.	0
1	yes, it is okay to have preferences. is it okay for a 60 year old man to prefer 20 year old women? no. is it okay for a 60 year old woman to prefer 20 year old men? also no.	I disagree.  Consenting adults can fuck who they choose to.  To suggest otherwise completely removes the self determination from individuals which is tyrannical.	0
1	Where did I say woman only ? Please show me	“It’s a choice to put an unprotected D@&$* (sic) inside you…”	0
1	Living in a country where the language has gendered nouns, that is definitely an attempt here. Can't have the generic masculinum because it "fails to include women"	Oh no they feel "offended over the presence of some words". They are such a joke.	0
1	They say it so we will be too confused when the mind games start, or so we won't notice the way they expect women to jump through more hoops than a circus animal.	This is it. It’s such a great manipulation tactic and a way to gaslight women.	0
1	A lot of that is men being deprived.  That doesn't make you privileged. (Some of it: "receiving disproportionately more funding for health issues that primarily affect your gender") does**you** privileged. (Some of it: "	It's the same "privilege" feminists have claimed for years about men and medicine.	0
1	But this is just a random person being silly. How does it threaten men’s rights?	i will admit, im honestly disappointed this one got so popular. not only is it one feminist being dumb, but there's way too many popular comments in this thread trashing her appearance.	0
1	A man can be raped (which is almost impossible to prove), forced to be a father, and trapped by child support for 2 decades.	I did not know that a male rape victim could have to deal with long term financial payments to a baby from that rape. Thus my view has been altered to include that the severities are closer than I thought. !delta	0
1	Right so a woman grabbing a guys junk should go into jail for at least 2 years?	yes if he’s fucking molesting him on a bus wtf is wrong with you guys	0
1	Just gonna point out this isn't technically true, tho 1979 since the last major women shooter is a rather large distinction.  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cleveland\_Elementary\_School\_shooting\_(San\_Diego)	Beat me by five minutes.  Exception that proves the rule?	0
1	Wow. Sounds like she had a really traumatic abortion	Exactly, imagine them saying "I was r4ped and it was traumatic, so let's celebrate it"	0
1	They said what it's meaning was.  It's a social construct  People who identify as being a woman are identifying as a particular social construct	Then it has no meaning if it's just a social label. If all it takes is that then I'm a chair	0
1	This sub is why we need feminism lmao	That's like saying blacks being afraid of White nationalists is why we need white nationalism.	1
1	This needs to be condensed into one sentence. That can be use to shut a conversation down. Like my body my right is used by women today . I do not know , maybe " my  DNA , my rights. "	Current birth control is already 99% affective when used correctly.	0
1	Yes plenty of men do, but comparing men to women I don’t see it being equal effort currently, considering the hetero orgasm gap and the number of women who still fake it to keep their partners.	Alot of women dont tell their man how to please them worried about offending them so they pretend orgasms	0
1	If my husband told me his daughter's breasts were "distracting" I'd be seriously concerned.	I genuinely get the feeling he hasn’t, her mother is projecting it onto him	0
1	I did get banned from /r/feminists and /r/femaledatingstrategy when it exists	What do you mean when it exists? Female dating strategy doesn't exist anymore?	0
1	Can we revert back to 90s feminism ? You know, when they were still feminine and not some toxic sick women	Do you think being feminine means underweight, drenched, and half naked? It was never meant to be "feminine" it was meant to be sex appeal and objectification. I understand why you would continue to want that.	0
1	Either you are cherrypicking or you have a very fragile female ego. Unless you back up your claim we will never know.	And thanks for the insult btw, real mature	1
1	Sweetheart don't feel bad. She is a grown woman and acts like that? It'll only get worse as the relationship carries on. I've been though it she will never stop interfering and crossing boundaries .	thank you. this means a lot.	0
1	Yes because these female abuse things are shown everywere while same happens to guys but its mostly laughed at or buried ofcourse you dont wanna hear that	and who are the same people who laugh at men? isn't it mostly other men that insult them or say they should have enjoyed it lmao	0
1	She could totally just plead the fifth, she’s so damn stupid.	I don't think she can because it's a evidence hearing, not a criminal trial. But IANAL.	0
1	I hope we get more men into psychological fields like counsellors, therapists and the like. I’d imagine that not many female mental health professionals would be comfortable treating men with these values.	>I hope we get more men into psychological fields like counsellors, therapists and the like.   the men in those feilds i encountered seem to be feminists too	0
1	MGTOW is an embarrassment to the men’s movement	like you who is an embarrassment for humanity for wasting oxygen	0
1	Lmao.  Men don't care about looks?  Some guy in here was telling me how women over thirty five can't date because they're out of their prime.  This is delusion.	To be fair, the number of men willing to date in that age bracket is much lower in comparison.	0
1	Every unit of time used for X means less time to do something else. That isnt discrimination, it's just women have one more option men do to weigh those opportunity costs.	By options, do you mean time spent towards career vs parenting?	0
1	I had a "friend " (25M) who would only date women 35+ and who would turn into a controlling abusive pos when they didn't do what he wanted He tried it with me, thanks to him I understood I'm done with straight male friendships	Why? Did he think they’d be desperate? Kinda reminds me of the Ashton-Demi dynamic. She says she pitted her against and compared her to younger women and used it to pressure her into doing things she didn’t want	0
1	Fuck you're not kidding, this is not the Dubai I remember. Also even though feminism isn't at the same level as in the west it'll probably get there in a couple decades now that they're allowed in government. Well shit, I give up.	Well shit, I give up.  Do not, fight for your cause, be an active mra and a good thing you can do is never give weapons to women, never make the mistake of having relationships with them or leaving them pregnant.	0
1	Fabricated by the winning party. Aka men. So yes. I’ll believe if the insecure shitty men in charge actually let women take credit for something they worked he’s to do for once. News flash. Women don’t need men.	Wow you're stupid. Good luck with your fabricated reality 😂🤣😂🤣😂	0
1	The only thing that I claimed was changing is the percentage of women who are earning the same or more than their male partners.	So things aren’t really changing much are they!	0
1	I mean generally when men are crazy we get murdered or assaulted so...	Didn't Donald Golver make that joke? (Childish Gambino but before CG)	0
1	The feminists are saying its not a double standard because these sex toys are modeled to be/look like women. The equivalent to dildos would be flesh lights, not life sized replicas of women.	So what’s the issue with that?	1
1	Annoying how gardasil was only marketed for teen girls when boys can be infected as well.   But to mention oral cancer affecting men.   But the burden of health is disproportionately placed on women.	Absolutely. It's so wrong the responsibility is put all j our shoulders. Our anatomy even makes us more susceptible to STIs than men. I've never done casual sex and never will. Men don't care about their health and definitely don't care about ours.	0
1	feminists don’t actively advocate against MGM because circumcisions are a legal/religion practice. it’s not a double standard, it’s just that FGM is a bigger issue than MGM	Mutilating baby dicks is a pretty big issue	0
1	okay but every misandrist is a feminist literally	i wouldnt say so. they may refer to themselves as feminists, but they dont fit the definition	1
1	I definitely understand. My girlfriend said the same thing so I’m curious how many women feel the same way. It’s a shame that women are uncomfortable around men because of the lack of self control men have.	Oh no that's not really it. I don't think I'd be harassed necessarily. I'd just be more comfortable. I understand if men want their own gyms too	0
1	Yes all them were men.	Okay. I just wanted to ask to be absolutely sure cause I haven’t read anything on the subject	0
1	You're literally saying that women can't make it a whole 8 hour workday because they have their pussy dripping blood. So mature.	“Tell me you know nothing about menstruating without telling me you know nothing about menstruating”.   Menstruation can literally have you shitting and puking at the same time, and can make you pass out.	0
1	Source?  https://www.rainn.org/statistics/victims-sexual-violence  https://ncadv.org/STATISTICS  &gt; Anyone can experience SV, but most victims are female -CDC  https://www.cdc.gov/injury/features/sexual-violence/index.html	Also bare in mind with NISVS that 12 months stats are always far more accurate as life time stats rely on prediction.	0
1	Yep, hating women is the point, context and nuance ruin the fun.	> I can't find a girl worth the effort --> hating women  Sure	0
1	feminist's I guess	nah man, they are so toxic that they intoxicate themselves	0
1	you sound insane… it’s really fucking weird that you think an interaction with one individual woman says anything about feminism. you’re insane	I'd imagine this was less of an isolated incident and more meant as a specific anecdote for a pattern.	0
1	Men giving their lives for their country so women can pose in front of the charred ruins to get likes and be called brave. Gotta love the modern world lmao.	I know right? Society is so cruel. Men are such pigs for objectifying women for their own use. How dare they serve as canon fodder that women can use to get likes on the internet.   /s	0
1	Bleeding out in a ditch versus an operating table hmm you are right, at least the woman in the hospital is on a bed before she dies.	Sounds like you have a shitty doctor if you die getting an abortion (which was an outcome of an action you chose to take instead of being forced to die against your will).	0
1	What replaces the tit percentage if you area straight girl	Right I guess swap with a bid juicy girthy cock?	0
1	Male feminists are the gender equivalent of an Uncle Tom.	Don't care if that might make us sound racist, agreed!	0
1	I still said it was okay for the baby to feed as long as the mother was covered.  I simply disagreed with the notion of the breasts being purely mammary and stated an anatomical fact.  You’re a massive prude.	Literally why would you be turned on by a baby sucking on it’s mums breast?? That aint sexual. Breasts arent sexual. Lots of people find feet sexually arousing, doesn’t mean they’re sexual	0
1	70-80% of the divorces are filed by women	Closer to 90 if she is college educated	0
1	She wasn’t. This was Russian propaganda against feminist. Turns out she was an actor and her victims were in for the ride.	BBC says it isn’t staged  https://youtu.be/OuEbdReyAnU	0
1	Are there feminist in this sub? And I have been banned from lots of subs for jut being here	Some feminists come to learn more about MRAs. Nothing wrong with that. We should welcome them.	0
1	I agree. This sub is not based on the opinion that women should stop having jobs and be a traditional wife who does house work and kitchen work, this sub is about opposing feminism.	That account was mine and it was a troll account, so don’t take it seriously. Thank you for reading.	0
1	If women have full authority when it comes to pregnancy,which they do. Then they should have full responsibility as well. So men shouldn’t get snipped or take birth control.	^ That was one of the points I was trying to get across. With their logic the woman should be responsible for the unplanned pregnancy, they fail to say that instead of only blaming the man.	0
1	Bras are extremely uncomfortable which is why many women don’t wear them. If this was a man in the photo would you have said the same thing? It’s not sexualizing yourself. It’s a nipple used for feeding children. Grow up.	It’s a nipple used for feeding a child approx 1-2% of the average woman’s lifespan. The rest of the time it’s a secondary sexual organ.	0
1	So on average all men are choosing to be engineers? Like your sole argument right now relies on a single job category	Walk into any high paying STEM field and tell how many women choose to do that.  The Theranos girl had the Feminist’s back for a minute. But then turned out to be a 4 billion dollar fraud who’s now going to prison. What are we to make of that?	0
1	Male privilege existing does not mean modern men created it.	Which male privilege? What can (and want ) a man do that a women can't?(excluding any body related stuff like helicopter)	0
1	This whole sub is a reaction to women gaining equality and men feeling oppressed. What you said literally encapsulates everything this sub is about. I'm sorry you don't like it but it is HILARIOUS.	>This whole sub is a reaction to women gaining privileges and men being oppressed.  Fixed it for you.	0
1	crazy how women make up shit like this but if you take one step outside you will see every girl with some variant of a cookie cutter chad	Where are you looking?	1
1	It’s actually hilarious how feminists preaches about how they are “just as capable as men”, but as soon as a war breaks out they stay quiet.	Feminist groups in my country are fighting with teeth and nails to either abolish the draft or make it gender neutral. You are making up hypocrisy to be outraged by.	1
1	I'd be for a woman's right to autonomy over her body if it wasn't a matter of killing another human being... It's not that I have something against women having rights, it's that I have something against people killing other people they don't want around.	Completely agree. At the end of the day, killing a human being should always be wrong.	0
1	Yeah that's perfectly normal behavior for a feminist I know as we all do, stuff it up your butt, have fun at the kitty cat hotel ya loony feminazi 🤡😜🤡😜🤡😜	God you men are so emotional, try using logic instead of your feelings when discussing important topics	1
1	She'll probably do well at the polls	Well, everything has been said, time to go home.	0
1	Most Gun stores and ranges will tell you that women are getting much more involved in shooting/guns for personal defense.	That’s a good line for sales no matter when it is.	0
1	I remember reading a few threads in a med sub about how “women are sexist because they choose female OBGYNS and it’s not fair for male OBGYNs out there” and I just…don’t want to live on this planet anymore.	My mother worked for a male obgyn (as an interior decorator) and he was constantly furious that women chose female doctors over him.  He was a complete asshole who treated his wife shitty.	0
1	This is what I came here to say,absolutely absurd. The most affected are women,I guess if you don't consider dying being affected. Because in every war throughout all of history the vast majority of the ones that died were men.	Men only died in war because they wouldn't let women fight!!  /s	0
1	Yeah I’ve just heard stories of women having to clean their husbands’/bf’s D’s cuz they are so dirty under that foreskin.	That's poor hygiene buddy. Through circumcision people lose some of their sensitive areas. Which makes sex less pleasurable.	0
1	Nothing. I'm questioning the people that think protesting in response to makeing rape illegal is a good idea to get people on their cause. It's not.	I am questioning you for invalidating a protest demanding gender-neutral rape law..     Whatever form that protest may be.. As long as its peaceful and demanding a just cause, it is valid.	0
1	I wonder if women 200 years ago said the same thing and if they took a time machine today, would be sorely disappointed	True. We've made some progress in the last 200 years but barely lol.	0
1	Against? Boy do I have some news for you about feminism	That doesn't respond to my question	0
1	As far as I know there is no gender based definition of women killing men, like femicide for women being killed by men.	> like femicide for women being killed by men.  Not so, femicide is killing a women because she is a woman.	0
1	Men are not the only reason humanity is where it is.  You're delusional.	Not the only reason. But nevertheless the primary reason.	0
1	This is why I feel we need to use the term “coercive rape” more often. I feel like if it was more mainstream maybe women would wake up a little.	Absolutely, a lot of women see it as ‘just giving in for peace’ as opposed to what it really is.	0
1	Triggered much from a reddit comment? Poor little misandristic women-worshipper :(	I just restated what you agreed with.   Sorry it makes you so angry to have someone explain to you that you and your entire approach is useless.	1
1	Very strange….this is at least the third post about it. As if not hitting women was an outrageous ask!	It's not an outrageous ask, but neither is it an offence against the Sky Daddy and you know that THAT is the problem here.	0
1	\&gt;She's not the person who cums inside a person, checkmate incel  She \*is\* the person who let someone cum inside her.  Feminists truly think women are mush headed children with no agency of their own.	It's pretty simple if you listen to them. Women have rights, but no responsibilities. Men have responsibilities, but no rights.	0
1	But do you see the problem with the "she was forced to" defense when the thing forcing her hand was usually the consequences of her own schemes?	Obviously but they are also consequences of people like the High Sparrow making his own decisions. You cannot put all the blame on her.	1
1	Apologizing women that kiled their kids. Feminism isn't fucked up at all /s 🙄.	Hey, it makes sense	0
1	June is Mens Health Month.	But what about history month?	0
1	&gt; Because females aren’t as sexual as teenage boys  OPs response to to same question	Oops. When I commented there weren’t any comments yet. I was too slow. Lol	0
1	This is what happens when the world stops paying attention to white women for 5 minutes.	They are so oppressed..	0
1	What a trash set of takes.  Train young men to not act like hungry dogs instead of requiring women to hide their beauty.	Both goes, but there are people that will go out of it as well.   It's like if there is a loose serial killer and there is a curfew, would you go out because "they should stop the killer instead of limiting the people"?	0
1	Animals can be female. Only humans can be women.	This is the explanation OP was asking for. Why is it at -2 points? Just because you don't _like_ it doesn't make it the wrong answer to the question.	0
1	Women should not have a license to be sexist.  If it’s wrong to be traumatized by a member of another race and then treat them all terribly cause of one event. Then it is wrong to do this to men as well.	It's not wrong to be traumatized by another race and then avoid them.   And where is this license that women have to be sexist?	1
1	The feminists with power in the US are making new gendered policies and laws. The feminists with power in the US are blocking reforms to make policies and laws gender neutral.	Such as? Gender neutrality is very much the zeitgeist	1
1	As usual, zero jail time for a woman who kills a man. That's depressingly predictable.	facts	0
1	I'm glad this statement isn't true.  Last I researched on the topic, less than like 30% of women identify as feminists iirc.  It's still a lot, but thank god it's not everyone.	do you have any Idea about India ? read the comments I wrote, India is highly woke, here 90% women are feminist wannabes, and 90% men are simps... ah god I hate em... I hate them BOTH -\_-	0
1	Boy they just like to make shit up don’t they?    I wouldn’t be shocked if some feminist cooked up a “study” to show how men leave sick women, though.  Nobody is as good at manipulating statistics and “scientific surveys” as feminists.	Bro just search it up on google	0
1	I'm not ashamed of any kinks except for my fetish for women wearing glasses. Thxs scooby doo.	My GF wears some CHONKY glasses, and ngl    She looks absolutely amazing in them. Sooooo guess I'm with you as well?	0
1	I'm a straight woman and I supported feminism back until around the 2010s, it's devolved into a toxic movement that harms both women and men.	Ah yes without a doubt, you are very very definetely a woman I really believe you	0
1	The toxic masculinity and pure ignorance in this comments are insane.   If you really think that women don't get opressed by men, then you live in a fantasy world. Even in western countries.	>toxic masculinity  There is no toxic masculinity.	0
1	this poster is a member of many feminist subreddits and is likely posting this in hopes someone will make a dumb comment, then they can post it saying 'look at these terrible incels'    mods need to remove this	the funny thing is, incel and simp pretty much mean the same thing	0
1	It only matters if it affects women.	Lmfaooo  They have no remorse about us losing 18years of our lives	0
1	shut up, i dont wanna hear a woman say that men deserve to die while women get saved just to raise their kids  let women fight for 2 centuries, we men are fine with house work  wanna trade ? no right ? then stfu now	Men can desert too. No one has to fight. I never said “men deserve to die” you’re projecting.	1
1	Educated women voters can still reproduce...	You just have missed the thread. There was a post a few days ago talking about how things were "better" back when women were used for breeding.	0
1	Women got the right to vote without having to register for the draft; feminism is and has always been about women wanting and receiving special treatment - not equality.     Currently, women have more legal rights and social privileges than men do.	Men made the laws you twat, it was men in power sending men to war and keeping women at home, without women every war would’ve been lost due to no people at home working in factories or farms	1
1	Where's the proof. Also if someone does something bad on womens day doesn't give you a reason to label all womens day as bad, or the people celebrating womens achievements as wrong.	Because throwing molotov cockyails is celebration.	0
1	What? Lmao at this. They're the ones being creeps to her. She doesn't really take advantage of anyone. The guys do the typical "put her on a pedestal because of how pretty she is" and she does her best to navigate that.	It’s a running gag that she always mooches food off of them.	0
1	Feminist in India, Israel have been protesting to not make rape laws gender neutral. Is this not feminism?	I actually didnt know about this one im going to have to read up on this stuff more	0
1	**It’s always been this way.** Men have never valued women or their relationships with us as having value. They have always seen shitting on us as a bonding ritual as well. We are just more aware of it.	It’s tough when you come to the realization, but it’s accurate.	0
1	Totally because men are quick to switch up on you and women are left to pick up the pieces. Always pursue  your goals and dreams. You’re an individual first before you are a wife/fiancée/girlfriend.	THIS comment should be shouted from the rooftops. You are an individual before anything else!!!!	0
1	You don't think rape has anything to do with access to abortion?	I don’t think rape has anything to do with financial obligation for a child of two parents that consented to sex. You know-the thing we were talking about	0
1	There is a lot of discrimination in the medical field....women make up the majority here.	women are the biggest haters coming from a male RN. Men in the nursing and CNA professions nearly never talk shit (unless they're the kind of guys that like to take it).	0
1	Weak people abusing is not abuse   -Feminist logic	Feminist logic  It's not alright to abuse a weaker person only if that person is a woman.  But it's absolutely okay to abuse a weaker person if that's a man.  All you need to really know in the end.	0
1	[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/antifeminists/comments/s7o03u/an_interesting_quote_and_point_against_feminism/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)	Well Im not sure thats the Best person to be taking advice from	0
1	Any sub moderated by any single feminist will have a feminist lean.	They kinda settled the question by suspending me for asking why men die for women so often...     https://www.reddit.com/r/antifeminists/comments/uq0vn8/suspended\_from\_purplepilldebate\_forerasking\_why/	0
1	the definition of feminism is: the political, economic, and social equality of the sexes. thats it.	Practice and preach almost always differ. Most of these “feminists” use it as a shield to spread hatred directed at men	0
1	No it’s not right. Men deserve support, not just a slight nod for shutting up about how they feel to protect women’s feelings	Forgot the /s.	0
1	The best you can do make dua for her right now. Maybe in her later years she can revert to wearing modest clothing.	aamiin, i pray thats the case!	0
1	Feminists aren't funny because you can't be righteous and funny at the same time.	Self-righteous	0
1	In America, it's best to assume all female are narcissists until proven otherwise. Feminaziism, like Liberalism, is a toxic disease that has been allowed to spread for generations.	That’s really fucking stupid	1
1	So why insist that men don’t want a male pill then, since that’s the implication?	I didn’t. You’re making presumptions	0
1	How exactly do you even define male gaze?	the male gaze is when men have eyeballs	0
1	Derailing these people just arbitrarily apply rules to whatever situation they deem to go against the feminist narrative. Utterly biased.	I am also part of that sub, just reading the QnA, and i gotta tell you that ***lots*** and I mean  #LOTS  of the comments there are deleted for "derailing"	0
1	it disgusts me. they preach equality but everyone knows it isnt about equality now. its about female supremacy and men being blamed for everything. feminism disgusts me to the core	It's never been about equality. Just read stuff by early feminists (Steinem, et al)	0
1	That fear is all brought on by the woman so don't blame men for it.  I fear women are destructive in the workforce so they shouldn't work - You see how dumb this sounds?	I think women should return to homemaking. I think they are better suited for that than whatever they are doing at work.	0
1	Agreed. A lot of men are feminists. Thanks for pointing this out as a correction.	And fortunately for men, a lot of women aren't feminists, they're egalitarian	0
1	And just like that, all Spanish men went MGTOW and the women went “screeeeeeeee …” 🤦🏻‍♂️	It's rational	0
1	Well feminism “says” it’s about equality.  We all know that, at its best, is a women’s advocacy movement.  They need to simply admit that, and stop pretending that they have all the answers, and a monopoly of the floor on gender issues.	I 100% agree	0
1	But 2 women's testimony is worth 1 mans.  Literally part of the law in some countries.  Funny how the numbers always work in their favor.	I love when the queens post (often): if women were so weak, why would men constantly oppress us? We are incredibly strong, and the patriarchy "needs" a rigged game for its perpetrators	0
1	There was one from the UK Version (Dragons Den) which had 2 Feminists on there, and they basically pissed off the 2 Women Dragons BIG TIME with their Feminist crap...	Link: https://youtu.be/dadNBfNmh5I	0
1	also my school did nothing for international mens day but had a massive event for womens day and they have signs plastered all over the school about how disadvantaged women and girls are and signs about the “wage gap” and shit like that it pisses me off	Wage gap is a imaginary monster they have created to fight men..	0
1	Pretty much. In many ways, the main difference is that they want to control men while respecting us, while the feminists want to control men while DISrespecting us.	They only *pretend* to "respect" men when those men have been used for their purposes. And even then it's lip service.	0
1	&gt;There are women in the MRA movement too  The ratio is much smaller however	So what? Is there a need for quotas? Try raising awareness and it will even out. Especially if you don't go the easy route that some feminists take and blame women for things feminists do.	0
1	When people say that toxic masculinity doesn't exist they are typically disagreeing with the notion of attributing toxicity to an entire gender. The things feminism claims is toxic masculinity are things typically reinforced by feminists.	When people say a thing they are saying the thing, and I'm not going to assume something they didn't say.   I'm so glad I posted that Inb4	0
1	This is no ending a discrimination, that would be to allow men to the save benefits, this is to discriminate against both.	Rubbish.  Giving benefits to women and denying them to men is discrimination.    I think it’s telling that they’d rather end programs for women rather than open them to men don’t you think?	0
1	We have Movember (November) for prostate awareness.  And November 19th is international men's day.  Both are actively crusaded against, but they exist.  What they need is awareness, it's shocking how many men don't even know we even have a day.	Also more awareness about steak and blowjob day?	0
1	I hate men… Literal misandrist	I see. Could you tell us why?	1
1	Women also have WGTOW :)	This is because liberalism teaches that "punching down" is always wrong. So....they're essentially allow this because they acknowledge women are somehow a weaker sex.	0
1	Then why are you on this subreddit lol, the solution to women’s oppression is feminism	Feminism just made my life worse and every single man afraid to be alone in a room with me so idk what you’re on about	0
1	He ? Lmao you are a girl and she still thinks you are a man ? Lmao feminist 2 brain cells cannot digest women being antifeminists too lol 🤣	It’s also pretty confusing. Imagine the horror when reality suddenly begins to force your brain to start perceiving women as individuals with their own unique experiences, opinions and values 🤯	0
1	Plus it’s in the constitution: the fourth amendment says, “The right of the people to be secure in their persons,” how are women  “secure in their person” when they are being forced to bring an unwanted pregnancy to term?	Agreed, I argue that point many times as well. Many didn't accept that argument, but whatcha gonna do?	0
1	I didn't give a fuck about height until women became single-mindedly obsessed with it.  My height is my height.  Fuck off.	Don't feel bad I'm tall and it doesn't help in that aspect of life at all.	0
1	The mum of the woman who made a bogus rape allegation says her daughter has been unfairly treated by the media and the family wants to put the incident behind them. that's why.	I don’t think the woman who made the accusation should move on, but her family definitely should. They aren’t responsible for anything their adult daughter does.	0
1	Okay. Some women don't want male birth control to be available because they don't want to give up the power of gendered legalized fraud and rape by deception to extract resources from men as a career choice.	Some meaning ... almost none of them.	0
1	Point remains. The vast majority of men do not commit these crimes, so any time feminists want to start shaming the rest of men for them, well they can get called out as bigots for it.	Yep but many men do. And that’s still a problem.	0
1	The biggest one for for me is that women have the right to bodily autonomy, unlike men.	You can strap a boy down and mutilate his genitals at birth with a knife and not only does no one care, but it’s encouraged.  Do the same to a girl’s and it’s an international human rights violation.	0
1	So man is a toxic, aggressive animal because of women? lol	Why bate a question like that fucking troll, you a bitch?	0
1	no, it means a world made by men, for men, right?	I think thats a fair simplistic assessment	1
1	Bro its not a subredit for this, we make fun of feminists, not regular women that failed	Actually it is. She's only in the cockpit of one of those because of feminist inclusive gender quotas.	0
1	The amount of people here saying they will only get drafted if woman also do instead of just not wanting draft to be a thing is midly worrying	Draft is not gonna be removed. So all our sisters are either gonna fight, or the men rebel and defend nothing.	0
1	Moronic as always  1# worldwide even without guns men die more. When accounted for the same method men are 40% more "successful" than women.  When you don't die you can reattempt.	Yep. It's so dumb to see this "women attempt suicide more" take.	0
1	im a feminist, not a misandrist, if the man isn't okay with it, then it's not okay. same rule for all genders.	all feminists are misandrists	0
1	Like they always say, no pain no gain. Though I don't know wtf you gain from pouring blood out of your vagina, cramps and unspeakable discomfort idk I'm not a woman	We gain chocolate and unnecessary benefits	0
1	I'm not ashamed of any kinks except for my fetish for women wearing glasses. Thxs scooby doo.	Well this makes me feel better 🤓	0
1	“Fight logic by fighting her feelings!”	This is such a common tactic! I love the way you said it	0
1	True, but you did not specify feminism, you went on about women in general.	If you understand how social dynamics work yes it is about women.	0
1	Shes waking up to the feminist hypocrisy	Quick! Ban her! She knows too much!	0
1	It's easy to say, but why would they want that. More like men would want to return and accept their terms, sadly	From what I read even young boys from age 12 are aware of the hostile environment school has become.  Men are aware and avoiding college.  Women have to take up the slack.	0
1	What's depressing is that it was only women who stood up for the boy.	Because the Internet is ful of fetishists who have seen too much Shota Hentai	0
1	Why do you keep using them as a shield for the fact that wealthy and connected women are advantaged by affirmative action?	It’s like you don’t realize that the experiences of black and brown women are DIFFERENT. They are not represented the same way or have the same opportunities. That is a problem. This is why you need to look at it through a racial lens as well.	0
1	Don't forget about feminists! They're to blame too	Misandrists maybe, feminists definitely not. There is a difference.  Just as there is a difference between mens rights and misogyny.	1
1	Pregnancy groups banning women who speak against MGM ?	Source?	0
1	Another post that is in no way related to anti-feminism. What's the point of this sub again?	The very title of the post makes it clear that this is a case of female arrogance, and the flair makes it clear that this,in turn, is the doing of feminism. But you already knew that, didn't you?	0
1	It means that he’s not valuable enough for a woman to accept him.	For every single male there is another single female. If those single females didn't go to some males harem, which is unlikely.  So, I don't think your relationship status shows your value...	0
1	Feminists are allergic to taking responsibility for their actions	For real. The amount of friends I know who vilify their bfs when they are being hoes I don't understand it and will never understand it and I'm glad they are miserable.	0
1	Men \*never\* stop acting like horny teen boys. Even men in their 40s/50s/60s with broken dicks still harass 20s and 30s women for sex. It's disgusting.	It’s a virus lol	0
1	Isn't the huge percentage of men also assaulted by....men?  Not trying to offend anyone but genuinely curious about this.  And I think more people should talk about issues on the other side iof gender inequality.	>Isn't the huge percentage of men also assaulted by....men?  Even if that were true, how does that matter in any way at all ?	0
1	ah yes, I see this often in that sort of “cancel culture” people create. using feminism in a more performative way, rather than actually living by the true prerogative. feminism can be totally subjective from one person to another, gets messy.	Yeah i agree	0
1	They're not joking; women initially got the right to vote without having the requirement to be eligible for the draft.      It was always hypocrisy and entitlement from the very beginning.	They were fighting for a right to vote because you should be entitled to that as an American. No one wants to die, of course they’re not going to advocate to be a part of the draft	0
1	Modern wives are mostly depressed and toxic in nature .. They may not be feminists.  Traditional wives with morals can raise good kids and keep a family intact.	Yeah, picking a wife who is actually interested in raising healthy kids is important.	0
1	And once they turn down half the fares, I bet they'll complain about making less money than male drivers.	Can men refuse to ride with women drivers?	0
1	Who is ranking every country on this "wife beating husband" stats?	This article was written by globalvillagespace.com and it said that this finding is from the UN survey report of domestic abuse and violence.	0
1	Ok so prostitution, porn actors and strippers should be illegal then, right? I have absolutely no problem with this. I thought feminists were the ones saying sex work is real work.	Pretty much all jobs should be illegal according to this logic, cause most people who work for money don't do it cause they want to, but cause they have to, to earn a living. The exception being unpaid volunteers.	1
1	I never said that. Chronic pain and illness is different. This is something that happens to every woman	You’re incredibly uninformed and ignorant. She’s going to dump you.	0
1	No way am I doing that. I shouldn't be unable to run a route around my house because of some girls who Don't realise their own double standard.	Females have a lot of social power. If you complain to your school you'll most likely be ostracised -- they'll either make a complaint against you or make up some rumours and spread them around  They have all the power. You have none	0
1	Yes.  Just because someone's a nepiophilia doesn't mean they'd actually do something to a toddler. So they might not cause harm. And even if they do, it's only 1 person.  Feminists *always* cause harm and thats on a social scale.	I'm talking about pople who want to rape little kids and toddlers and talk about their desire to do it online. If you look up screenshots of Nathan Larson or "Rapey", you can see just how fucked up they are.	0
1	Some woman keeps harassing me i dunno what to do anymore	Report her to the police	0
1	Women are asked to show any emotional support to their loved ones, and they post shit like this	I think there's might be a difference between showing emotional support and adopting an underdeveloped man child as a new mother like so many neckbeards want.	0
1	Ten months in a woman’s prison in the UK is basically not much of a punishment. She probably won’t even spend the full ten months.	Bet she's out after 5 max	0
1	They are making fun if feminists	You sure?	0
1	Wait. So, not only do women suck at REAL sports but they also suck at FAKE sports? LOL!	female grandmaster	0
1	This entire wave of feminism has not been about equality. It is about subversion and domination.	of course lol. and we have all known this for decades now, as men die to drugs and despair and misery, and the ruling class ships all of the jobs overseas.	0
1	They’re just openly sexist now. This is becoming the new norm and it’s tragic. In 40 years men will be treated like dirt.	>breaks Reddit TOS daily  >Never gets banned  Wut	0
1	5$ for many…up to 100$ or so for some. Nonetheless, its the ones who don’t objectify themselves that are truly human and it’s the women who don’t put a price to themselves that are priceless.	Just because someone likes being sexual doesn’t mean they’re an object. If you think a woman is putting a price on herself because of the price she puts on sex, it goes to show you don’t actually know the inherent value of people.	1
1	Well.. you did make a bit of a crazy statement about Feminism. Does no one ever make fun of that here?	no idea i just joined it yesterday	0
1	This! I also suffered abuse while on the apps and was subjected to sexual harassment almost daily. I just don’t understand why women continue to put themselves through it. If it happened to one women, it’ll happen to you. No ones an exception	Exactly ! Some of the messages I’d get were 🤮. I’m just hoping they’ll die out eventually/hookup culture is on its way out. I think many treat you like crap online because of the lack of jugement from his peer group.	0
1	Evidence #100975647762648348: Men f\*ck women, but LOVE other men	Also men love to fuck women so they can go tell their BoYs they fucked you	0
1	A woman’s brain biologically works faster and harder than this lol and no woman would use such gross, misogynistic comments.	Lmao so if I prove that I’m actually a woman will you stream eating an ounce of human feces in apology? Because then you have a deal 😍	0
1	Let women rise you scrotes.	Scrotumlicker	0
1	I just did. You didn't mention "men" anywhere in your first comment.	Cool guess it wasn't to you	0
1	Men are implements	Karen Straughan said in a very long post a few years ago that men are tools and that our best path forward is to be better tools. This is one of the few cases where I disagree with her.	0
1	It's not right how little serious stories are more commonly know when this would happen to a woman they would have a whole platoon of people.	Yeah honestly looking back on it it was so strange because they were attractive young women, I’m glad i didn’t who knows they might have killed me or something.	0
1	And here’s why people think feminists hate men.	They do. Those that speak the loudest	0
1	We absolutely need mens shelters. I don’t know the statistics but a significant amount of men are sexually assaulted and deserve help.	Yes! Right now there's very few, if any. And feminists are protesting against men's shelters and men's suicide awareness groups. I can't help but feel bad for every guy that's experienced abuse/sexual abuse.	0
1	Nine of those women are obese though? Just overweight	Are you fucking kidding me? You think the 2nd column isn't obese? You're a burger aren't you? No wonder America is the fattest first world country on the planet.	0
1	This isn’t real feminism. This is fake woke mainstream feminism. We need Andrea Dworkin back	No we really don’t	0
1	See, this is a silly sub.  We don't draft women for the same reason we don't want women firefighters.	Draft only women then	0
1	No. Just stop.  [Here's a good video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYPLugx3lrE&amp;ab_channel=CityCrusher) for ya that shows that toothless dog JP for what he really is - a cope tradcon, begging women to be nice.	The feedback from the entire World disagree with you.  I will look at your page. I will report here the results.  Perhaps you hate men.	0
1	Some guy on here made up a story about getting into an argument with his feminist roommate because she feels entitled to his time and attention and threw things at him and claimed he was oppressing her. I’m what universe is that a real interaction	That case sounds made up but also feminists tend to violently overreact	0
1	A wrongful dismissal if she does fire her	In what state is it illegal to fire someone for taking time of for a vacation?	0
1	Furthermore in the UK male victims of sexual or domestic abuse are now being defined as "victims of violence against women".	Yeah, I saw that. Utterly abhorrent!	0
1	That's just a manifestation of being granted power without responsibility.  Women like this are just itching to feel what it's like to tear a man down.  They imagine it's what it would have been like to be royalty and saying "off with his head".	I think they imagine this is what it's like to be a regular dude. Lol	0
1	You're right "Tell me you don’t know what feminism is without telling me it." Is a really dumb quote, especially in this context. You'd have to be borderline retarded to say it unironically.	No, but thanks for caring :)	0
1	Feminists are the human version of period cramps 😬.	Lol, you said it!	0
1	That’s a misleading title that only pushes generalizations. That is _one woman’s_ strategy to earn money. _Most women_ want to earn money the same way everyone else does: by having a job. You’re not helping anything by lumping all women in with this.	I wrote "A woman"	0
1	1. woman shoots man in head and sees 6 months in prison 2. woman rapes 11 year old boy and gets (very likley less than she was sentenced to in jail)  what next?	In india a man went to prison for 6 months for showing the middle finger in a woman's presence.	0
1	Since when this sub has become "uuuuu women bad uuuu" ?	It didn't lmao	0
1	Men should have reproductive control of their own body, that’s kind of the point.	You do. It's  called a condom.	0
1	Can you give an example of masculinity being expressed in a toxic way? Not getting defensive. The problem here is definitions	For example pushing it on others by shaming men who arent traditionally masculine. Reinforcing gender roles expecting women to submit to someone, using masculinity as a weapon against both women and men who dont fit in that mold	0
1	Are you female?	Ah the pertinent question	0
1	I'ts because some people don't deem men "worthy of any form of power."	Who is saying this stuff? All I’ve heard is overwhelming gratefulness from my female friends lmao	0
1	… when you learn how to read, you’ll see that no one is defining masculinity, but that no one actually wants you to experience loneliness just because you’re a man.	Your postings are toxic femininity. Stay in your own lane.	0
1	Nope never had. 3rd wave feminism is just toxic	So was 2nd wave feminism... and the suffragettes for setting up the double standard in the first place of women having the vote but not being drafted.	0
1	Are women seriously trying to normalize knowing more about men than men themselves?	I agree with her. Porn addiction is probably the leading cause. And ED should not be normalized. IDK how this has anything to do with feminism though.	0
1	Well I was not discussing men. You brought men up to dismiss the point I was trying to make about women to belittle that problem.	Apparently pointing out facts is belittling problems. Keep going with the mental gymnastics.	0
1	Feminists should try pushing for equalizing responsibilities once in awhile.	It’s like that’s… the whole point of feminism	1
1	Two women die a week as a result of violence from a partner in the UK  A campaign highlighting this is not saying violence towards men is ok	Why not make posters gender neutral ?	0
1	It’s called postpartum depression it’s unspoken about just like ptsd in men	Ummm excuse me 4 times more men suffer from deppression and it is never spoken about. I almost k!lled myself because of it	0
1	She gives me fat waist vibes	She gives me neck so fat it is restricting the flow of blood to her brain vibes.	0
1	I can't tell if you seriously think the majority of women prefer clean shaved men or not	Am woman. I like men, not boys. Men are hairy	0
1	I never gave my opinion on her lmao. When she gives speeches or talks during lawmaking sessions, she’s very loud and assertive, to some that’s threatening. Either because she’s a woman, or just because some people don’t like being told off/what to do	>I never gave my opinion on her lmao  You said you can't stand her. That sounds like am opinion to me.	0
1	Believe all women.    Tell that to family of Emmett Till	God, I wish I didn't have to think of that story anymore...	0
1	&gt;show me the feminists who say that men are OK the way they are.  Plenty of men are. Many aren't. Some men need to change. Lots don't.	We're talking about feminists, are you a feminist?	0
1	Yet if a woman did the same, she’d be seen as gold digging dead weight.	Exactly. The post states he cooks and cleans. Why do I feel like this *really* means "pops in a frozen pizza and wiped up the red bull spill from a knocked over can when he chucked his controller in a fit of rage".	0
1	The feminism sub says "This is a war brought about by elite men, and the consequences fall disproportionately on women, children and other vulnerable populations."  What the fuck? What about normal men living their normal lives?	honestly its so dumb its funny but not in a good way like in a depressing funny way	0
1	I think nowadays it's less about asking the father for permission and more about letting the family of the woman know in advance so that the wedding doesn't come as a huge shock to them.	So, the family of the women gets to know about the wedding before she does? Before she's even agreed? That makes zero sense.  The couple can tell both their families after the proposal has happened.	0
1	Ah but the thing is if a woman wants her tubes tied doctors can refuse cause what if your husband wants one, also circumcision can be nessasary in some cases	There was a post a little while ago that was a man complaining that he was told that he couldn't get a vasectomy without his wife's permission. So this is something that affects men, too.	0
1	cute list but 'they love to be treated like a baby'?! I've never heard any woman say she wants to be treated like a baby lol	Not exactly like a baby but a kid. Me for example, loves headpat	0
1	well then that’s fine she’s a girlboss 💅💅	BossBabe!	0
1	How often do men get raped?	Not often -- too busy being murdered.	0
1	Back when? This is present day.   And I'm curious, what is your definition of women trying to act like men? Are you referring to women working outside the home?	It was better for everyone when one parent worked and one parent stayed home	0
1	Like what can women not do without their husband's consent	Get their tubes tied	0
1	Prior to feminists existing, how did things get to be unequal to begin with?	Mainly by the Industrial Revolution and before that by the fact that men had more muscle mass and were therefore better suited for wars. In addition, the reproduction played a role in the fact that women were not sent to war.	1
1	Ah, yet another example of feminist wanting control over male sexuality. The double standards are profound. They complain about male sex toys yet have had dildo's for decades. When someone points out their hypocrisy their brains literally short circuit.	The feminists are saying its not a double standard because these sex toys are modeled to be/look like women. The equivalent to dildos would be flesh lights, not life sized replicas of women.	0
1	They make everything a gendered issue until it comes to doing things like paying for dates, changing tires or repairing a roof in the middle of summer. I’ve yet to hear a feminist discuss gender equality then.	Or going to war.  But dare to launch a movie without a woman kicking ass in the front lines...	0
1	Be careful, some feminists are gonna call you a “pick me.” Happened to me many times 🙄	whats a pick me? Is that like some feminist version of 'uncle tom' like a female traitor? xD   thats amazing.	0
1	The rest of the house is a shared space. Why do you think men deserve an entire area just to themselves but the women don’t? Why not just use the shared spaces for their intended purposes anyway?   It’s sexist is all it is.	Because she'll get to decorate the rest of the house as she sees fit.	0
1	Anaconda and other such songs by female rappers aren't an honest expression of female sexuality they are for the male viewers to see T&amp;A	I mean you have a point, but there's also things like magic mike, and numerous chick flicks. I think the quote is absurd.	0
1	Romcoms suck. Except "The Sweetest Thing".  I have never laughed so hard at anything as much as the penis song. Such mockery!  Heal yourself from runaway bride, try "The Sweetest Thing". It's a great woman adventure-bonding-silly flick.	When Harry Met Sally holds up pretty well for modern audiences, too. It's still one of my feel-good, dreary-autumn-weekend movies.	0
1	Dude, come on, let's be reasonable here. Which statistics say that? Feminists don't just blame men.	http://www.breakingthescience.org/SimplifiedDataFromDHHS.php	0
1	She essentially has.	No she hasnt she wants to get married, but says he is the one that has to propose, in her time frame and otherwise he is gone, thats toxic, and she can also go down on one knee and pop the question.	0
1	Men are so patient with trash women. We need to stop being so gentle with those POS. Using his children... what the fuck...	Sadly if they gave back a tenth of the shit they did then they’d be sitting in prison for torture	0
1	&gt;A woman’s value is determined by the man she’s with  The fuck ?	She has no value for herself lol. Wtf it's like she's born to fulfill her man's wishes, she doesn't have her own life lol moron	0
1	toxic masculinity doesn't exist, and people that use that term are fuckwits. Don't waste your time conversing with them.	It does exist it’s just misused. Toxic masculinity is when people believe it’s not masculine to be open and honest with your feelings and things like that, which happens all the time.	1
1	I'm not. It all depends on what it is they're teaching/mentoring.  They can keep saying "aims to help young men realize potential", but if it's the same old feminist crap then it's basically a Gender Studies course.	So ignoring young boys is bad. But teaching them is bad too.  Do you wonder why young men are left behind?	0
1	It will never happen. Reddit in a nutshell? Men, generally speaking, super bad. White men? Worst. Pure evil. Not even human f@kin' beings. Women? Always right, always good, quasi-Goddesses. Nothing to worry about.	And they say that women are discriminated in every way possible.	0
1	Men are 300% more likey to kill cops than women.	And some dogs are dangerous solution kick ever dog you see	0
1	So you care what feminists think? Why? If you listen to content and you enjoy it but another is offended. That means it’s not a you problem, it’s their problem.	I do. When feminists hate a certain program/people, i can be sure that those are something i will now be interested in	0
1	That's the basis of feminism	This part specifically:  > Feminism makes no rational sense. Women aren't equal to men - they are above them. We can do whatever we want and not be held responsible.	0
1	Well it isn't the same. Clearly. It's far more damaging and humiliating for a man to be raped.	Men and women are very different, but we're all human, and one thing common to the human experience is how being raped can really screw you up in the head, big time.  Men or women, rape is bad, end of story	1
1	Oh no! Women have to be responsible and in control of thier bodies during and after sex! You do know birth control, male and female condoms, and plan b exist?!	> birth control, male and female condoms, and plan b exist  This draft specifically, directly states that the case ruling that made contraceptives legal to buy in red states should also be overturned.	0
1	Yup I’m sure he does. The newest iteration of the patriarchy is to brainwash women to be doormats 🤡	Yep now physical and financial domination is less easy than it used to, let’s go for emotional coercion to keep the patriarchy going…..	0
1	You do realize that women make up the majority of the audience for beauty pageants?	You do realize that there are women who think that gender inequality doesn't exist, right?  I promise you **do not** want to have this conversation with me.  &#x200B;  Have a great night.	0
1	I think this shows two things well, the largest critic of women is other women, and their failure in careers is because they too heavily pay attention to their relationships with coworkers.	Potato with guns	0
1	Arguing with a woman is always a waste of your time.  Always.  Go get a job and make some money.  Money is power.  Arguing is not power.	Women are worth my lords just the same as men. I make my judgement based on content of character and not what is between someone’s legs	1
1	So the problem, is these women won't stay in their terrible marriages. That's why single mothers are at fault?	The problem is that courts won't give men custody even when the mother is proven to be the toxic and self-destructive one in the marriage. That's why you usually see sons of single mothers be the perpetrators of these crimes.	0
1	The police in the UK will find a way to use this against women.  They always do.	They are so useless. They kept insisting I had good reason to report my ex for the harassment and abuse he was giving me, I finally agreed and reported him. And what happened? Absolutely fuck all. They gave him a verbal warning and that's it.	0
1	So she doesn’t see an issue with killing children 😂these women are lost they need to be expelled from any form of civilization built by men and gtfo ain’t nobody got time to deal with this.	Pretty sure it was an ironic post.	0
1	Hate women much?	Not in the slightest. I understand women.	0
1	The good thing about a prostitute is your paying her to pretend to like you so there’s no confusion. Women will pretend to like you for multiple reasons and I don’t do fake love.	I don’t need any woman to pretend to like me. 😂Just need the puss occasionally without jumping through hoops to get it	0
1	She will magically appear and shit on their beds instead!	Only if you repeat her name 3 times in front of the mirror.	0
1	Actually, women are the only ones who menstruate. You know, biological women. Not pretend women or women who turned themselves into men and kept their parts. If you menstruate and have the proper plumbing, you're a woman no matter what you do to yourself.	no need to be transphobic.   what does “biological woman” mean?  Maybe you should read a human sexuality textbook since seems you don’t even know the right terms so we can have a discussion to be on the same page.	1
1	It’s benevolent sexism. People expect men to be stoic and self reliant but portray women as damsels in distress in need of protection	>benevolent sexism.  That's made up Feminist bullshit, its Sexism Towards Men! Men deserve just as much men support as Women do but they don't get it because no one likes Men.	0
1	I'm talking about treating men as ATMs, guard dogs, decorations for women and status ladders for them. I'm talking about abusing of men who don't fulfil female demands (read: male gender role). I'm talking about discrimination of gender non-conforming men.	This is why history needs to be considered and not forgotten.	0
1	They’re like female incels in the sense they view men as a tool to use than a actual person. Think they’re superior to men and the dating “strategies” is them just playing men and blatantly hating on men. Subreddits get banned for less.	The fact that they need strategies to get men says all I need to know about these women lmao	0
1	That’s feminists for you	Wasn’t there a guy in Canada who opened 1 was forced to shut down then killed himself because the harassment ?	0
1	No, you guys are just jealous of women finally standing up against the patriarchy, and not being subservient to men. That's why your f*ckin male ego has been hurt	Haha nice joke mate.	0
1	Never in my life have I seen men so interested in a case of domestic violence, ever.	Many of us have been abused and had no recourse to justice.  At least Johnny might get some kind of justice.	0
1	This is not the thing women like about. &amp; less than 8% of reported rapes have been found without merit. Not to say it didn’t happen but, there wasn’t enough evidence to move forward.   I don’t think men lie. I think people lie. What dumb thing to say.	> & less than 8% of reported rapes have been found without merit.  That does not mean that 92% of rape accusations are true.	0
1	What % of women will resort to using coat hangers?	Dont know. Im sure if we outlawed the coat hangers then we would have less deaths	0
1	Most men are stronger than most women.   And go ahead and try to stick your finger up a random guy’s ass. See how well that goes for you. You’d probably end up getting gang raped.	You're really gross. Acting like male rape victims don't exist	1
1	Must admit. I'm not keen on changing a baby's nappy...or wiping a geriatric man's ass (or woman's) as a nursing aid in geriatric care. Women seem to be MUCH better at that sort of thing.	We don't support female supremacy and we don't support misogyny either	0
1	😂 looking forward to hearing it! And it’s only a double standard  in your head. I’ve never heard of a woman wanting to settle down with a “player”.  Please find another reason to be offended	You can change a player but you can't change a hoe.	0
1	I predict these cringe posts will be blamed on men.	I predict these cringe posts shall beest blam'd on men  ***    ^(I am a bot and I swapp'd some of thy words with Shakespeare words.)  Commands: `!ShakespeareInsult`, `!fordo`, `!optout`	0
1	Why can’t we be assertive without being called masculine….	Because their masculinity is so fragile anything except crawling before them makes it crumble like last year's birthday cake.	0
1	Mega ultra simp.   If even one woman is murdered all men need to be locked up.   Something tells me he's in for a big surprise should his wife leave him.	Which is highly likely. He is a beta wimp with a good income, the best sort of ex-husband.	0
1	People aren't even allowed to think that slutty women are slutty anymore because that's "judging them". No. It's calling a spade a spade.	My only problem with calling someone slutty is that people don't even care of she's not a slut. If they hate her because she's cute and has men dying after her she automatically becomes a slut.	0
1	Because to be anti something doesn't mean its a hate group.  Feminist groups can be hate groups too.  I'll wait for either the ban from the sub or the down votes	it is literally a hate sub. stop hiding behind hypotheticals, you coward	0
1	Exactly, but there are still the False Rape records (as rape is charged upon men)  That is one thing which can show the state of men... It was terrible, 75% false... She did bring that stats... With proof of sites and reliable government web portals...	It's just india getting more toward West society. Next gen India will be totally diff.	0
1	Yeah I think opening an onlyfans is different from being in a drug trafficking circle dumbass.. The logic of antifeminists is nonexistent	Yeah sure it is. How many diseases do prostitutes spread? 20% of the US population is reported to have an STD.	0
1	men are sick of being told that we're evil and women get extra help and are constantly encouraged...This doesn't happen for our young men.  I am afraid we're about to take a massive fucking shit when it comes to our leadership in science and tech.	The fact that there is nearly zero media coverage of this tells you how much society cares about boys and young men. They rather worry about girls/women being merely looked at the wrong way. Pathetic	0
1	No, I am just not sure what you mean. Where’s the caricature of men?	Haha so funny	0
1	I was thinking women who are less than a D cup, but that workstoo.	Thing is braces, breast implants and losing weight are much easier than adding inches to your height...	0
1	As a person from India I would like to say Fukk feminism Fukk wokeism.	Stay strong brother	0
1	More BS from male feminist troll trying to remove accountability from women	I was assuming that as I read it but didn’t wanna y’a know 😬	0
1	Stop lying feminist.      Go away	I mean I’m not lying in my personal queer experience I have been called a faggot, a tranny, Frankenstein’s monster, etc etc all by CISHET men.	0
1	No woman should be dating if she's over 30 or 40. She's waaaay past her prime.	You're part of the reason we're all called misogynists. Do better.	1
1	They better watch out, that's a good way to get banned. You can't say bad things about women on reddit. They should know, that's how they get around any bans. Oh wait, they are women so it's ok	Yeap.	0
1	Once again I thought I was going to be rickrolled... Nope, it's actually a site.... Who knew so many men had an attachment to their foreskin or lack of one. Anyway, feel free to protest and kick up a storm. I'll quietly continue with other things.	Tuck your tail and run when it happened to you were screaming for revenge.  The old you would have.been ashamed of the new you. You deserved your whole body.	0
1	Men don’t WANT to make home furnishing or vacation decisions, what a joke. You are reframing a burden on women as power. Utterly ridiculous.	How do you know? Did you ask every single one of them? Cuz nobody asked me!	0
1	Because society presumes that women do no wrong when treating men, and that only men need to improve.   This agenda is pushed by both sides. The left cite the patriarchy, the right cite chivalry.  Two sides of the same coin.	This.	0
1	I've never heard a single person say "sluts deserve to get shot"	Ive never met any of these incel woman haters they claim are everywhere either, been called an incel tons though because apparently when i say i  disagree with feminism what they hear is 'sluts deserve to get shot'	0
1	Real feminists laugh at male suffering and death. And they cheer on male conscription.	*citation needed*	0
1	Remember, your wife can accuse you of rape (like mine did) without ANY proof, and you will be charged and prosecuted.  This is the society we are living in now.	That’s true.  But doesn’t excuse this creep though.	0
1	Men tend to the extremes, both good and bad.  We have to acknowledge the murderer and the rapist as well as the scientist and the doctor.	many places in the word do not even record women raping men as a crime.      Why not join the feminist movement if you want to brag up how evil men are?	0
1	I'm trying to discuss how men are doing and we, as men, aren't stepping up to that.  Is it okay if we discuss that?	Society enforced it on men? Stop minimising the role of women played in sending men to war.	0
1	Again, implying that "men" are the real "problem" with humanity, and society should be a "Matriarchy" instead.	The problem isn't me or us, it's you or them !  /s	0
1	repeal gun control but only for women, give them out free with free training	I can see it now - men attacking women specifically to steal their guns. While they're at it, might as well have some fun too.  Why not just put a bounty on every woman's head you absolute plank?	0
1	Because she's female	ooh daring today arent we	0
1	I want men to do betteer	You are clearly a feminist troll, go and shave your smelly armpits will you	0
1	Ironically we love women,  We just hate people that use gender to perpetuate hate	right like I love my wife, but if she tried that \*boot\* although she is from the Phillipines and has more traditional values that don't really allow for that she didn't marry me for cash either i'm broke AF	0
1	Feminism is female supremacy.	So is that yes to walking you through google?	0
1	Yeah highly educated women who pull them selves up through hard work and don’t forget where they came from are they worst! They might actually hold rich white men accountable and we can’t have that.	I think you’re misconstruing my comment. Let’s not pretend that AOC is middle class, because she’s certainly not. She may have came from a middle/lower class background, but she is certainly a wealthy woman these days.	0
1	That's fucked up.  Those dudes better start identifying as female reeeal quick.	I'd give you an award, if I didn't think awards were complete BS false economy.	0
1	How has meToo made it harder for men to come forward? It's always been hard for men tk come forward and still is. MEtoo changed nothing for men.	Are you kidding?  Try thinking about your own question for five minutes and if you still can't figure it out I'll answer you.  Think about a man like Depp abused by his spouse and seeing the MeToo movement.	0
1	Unironically, yes. At some point, certain groups of women forgot that sex is for making babies and making babies is good.	Culture has been redefined to perceive sex as a casual thing when it has always been very serious with heavy consequences if done unsafely.	0
1	As many times as I've been in the men's room and had women barge in, for too long men have had to put up with behaviors in what should be private spaces that make them feel uncomfortable and violated.	Same thing happened to me a couple weeks ago, a group of three girls walked into the men’s room in my high school for no other reason than for shits and giggles. Source: I witnessed and promptly reported this	0
1	I don’t. Mainstream media is garbage. All of them. Democrats seem to be the only people who somehow haven’t figured this out yet	I agree mainstream media is garbage! Fringe on either side however is far worse.	0
1	&gt; That’s hard to do with this Supreme Court too. Or was it a local state Supreme Court?  NC State Supreme Court with a 4-3 Dem majority.	Explains it.   My assumption based on the headline was republicans majority us Supreme Court.  Thanks for the clarification	0
1	Description: Black, thin, dreadlocks.   Austin, TX: 7.8% black population, assume 3.9% male.   We've removed over 96% of potential suspects if every black man in the city is thin and wearing dreads. But that's just not good enough.	They also said thin, d So that bumps it from 96% to like 98%	0
1	Interesting fact of the day. He’s actually not entirely sure if he is black or not. He has a white mother and an Italian father, and he doesn’t know where in his family tree a black person is.	.... Say your mom cheated without saying your mom cheated.	0
1	Well, slavery used to be legal in a democracy. And in many places slavery wasn't banned by the people, but was removed through brute force	Slavery cannot exist in open and free democracy because it wouldn't be open or free.	0
1	But that's denying people based on gender, not them being rude or anything. It's like "white people should deny black passengers because all black people are /insert stereotype/"	It doesn't have to be white people. It could be white women.  Denying BLACK MALE passengers.  Which would be clearly WRONG.    And yet denying ALL MALE passengers is somehow acceptable.	0
1	I completely agree that it was complicated, but slavery, while not necessarily the only reason,  was still probably the biggest reason. It was the slaveholding class that initiated secession.	Note that slavery is listed as one of those reasons in most (if not each) of the Declarations of Secession.	0
1	A Republican just has to do his actual job to be called a hero now.	Not rat fucking the country he swore to serve is *amazing.*	0
1	Do you believe there are no qualified black women?  That's what you are suggesting if you are upset about it.	Do you believe there were no qualified white men for the past 200 years? That’s what you are suggesting if you are upset about it.	1
1	Republicans, seriously, how can you fucking vote against that bill!?	To get an actual answer you'll need to manage to post this to r/Conservative	0
1	Election is only 4 days away. Youngkin appears to be peaking at the right time. Of course Democrats may "find" ballots sometime late on election night.	So far it's looking good.  https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/783764229470945361/903669201007415346/ads4swoM.jpeg	0
1	Where did I say the current court isn't 'quite capable'?  But if an opening popped up in that all black woman court, yes it would be appropriate to say, "we should try to make a more diverse choice for this opening".	> Where did I say the current court isn't 'quite capable'?  I thought you implied that a court lacking racial diversity is less capable than one with racial diversity. Is that not in line with your thoughts?	0
1	Oh I'm sure somehow the Democrats don't lose everything in midterms the day after the midterms they're going to have widespread masks and lockdowns	I fear this will happen.  Annihilate the economy as an excuse to bring in Socialist policies.	0
1	Then why were there reports about him being unable to recall any black people working at his offices?	What black people would want to work for him in the first place. He probably has racial biases just like every human on the planet and he’s a garbage human but he is not really comparable to outspoken white nationalists in terms of racism	0
1	When you can’t imagine a black woman being qualified… well, there’s a word for that.	The conservatives I personally know have an issue with him saying that only a black woman is qualified	0
1	Ok, and what about Clarence Thomas’s “high tech lynching”?  Oh right, that makes them look like a bunch of racists, so they would never headline his name.	Joe Biden headed that committee.	0
1	As a former Mississippian for 22 years, I also concur.	Tennesseean right behind y'all.	0
1	I still don’t understand that shift. How did the south become the Republican Party so fast? The Civil Rights act had bipartisan support - the split was very clearly between north and south.	It was targeted. The Southern Strategy.	0
1	And it's crazy that they'd even try to blame Republicans, they must think we're all idiots with terrible memory loss.	It's not even that they think we've got memory loss. *It's because they can* their voters are brain dead and believe anything they hear, and there will be no repercussions for these lies.	0
1	Which is the whole point of the provisional ballot. I'm still not convinced she actually broke the law, other than being black in America.	Black AND female.	0
1	Yes. When have the Democrats ever had spines enough to stand up for themselves or for the rule of law?	The last time there was an attempt at a coup. Short memory?	0
1	Yup Democrats didn’t support keeping slaves/s	took a sec to notice the /s at the end. yeah	0
1	I decided to listen to it to see if the voice was there, did I get affected by the black Magic? I am so scared and I feel dumb for attempting to do it	lol this is not how black magic is done relax	0
1	Do you mean 50 Republicans? Did one die and I missed it? 🤣	I did  But I stand by my mistake because Mitch doesn't really count as a person.	0
1	So an African American isn’t African?	Why would they be?	1
1	Of course I've left Maryland plenty of times, but Spain denying black people in bars and clubs doesn't take away from the many injustices of black people in the US.	Of course not, but that isn't the discussion.. you said that america is the worst at it, it isn't.	0
1	You said it's "evolutionarily advantageous" to value white people over black people. That's a wierd thing to say.	from the perspective of a white person, the opposite would be the case from the perspective of a black person.  Have you really bever heard of this concept??	0
1	Unless Republicans vote for him he is toast . Presidential year and WV is now a ruby red state. Seriously he barley won last time (2018) too and now he has a big target on his back	It’s not impossible for him to win. Basically he’s like the democratic version of Susan Collins. Collins pulled off the victory in Maine despite Biden beating trump there pretty badly	0
1	Clayton Bigsby	Clayton show us your face brother! *head explodes*	0
1	Hunter Biden, the most irrelevant "political" figure of all time that somehow the right is convinced is a crucial talking point for...something.	hunter biden himself isn't, but his laptop that contains undeniableproof of joe biden's corruption (and which was hushed up by the corpo media and silicon valley until after the election) is.	0
1	Blacks can’t be racist   They’re the target of all racism and oppression how can they be racist	Yes blacks can be racist. Anyone can be racist	0
1	You don't think black people deserve to celebrate the ending of their enslavement in the USA?	I don't think i need to hear about slavery every fucking day like i do now from the dems and media.  It happened.  It was awful.  It was not unique to the united states though and we need to just move the fuck on with our lives.	0
1	Believing nonsense and living in their own reality is why we will never get along with Republicans.	People like Ted Cruz don’t believe the stuff.  They’re just evil and using disinformation to get and keep power	0
1	Is the article about  Rep Pelosi?  If you think Rep Pelosi fleeced Democrats , nothing stopping you from posting an article proving so.	My point is that this isn’t a trump problem, this is a corrupt political culture.	0
1	No it isn't.   It's a straight forward question.   You can't claim the unborn is just a clump of cells and also insist he ended 2 black lives.	It's a double standard. Kind of like how many Christians treat atheist men better than Christian women.	0
1	Look at Ken Paxton in Texass.  He's been under indictment for 7 years.  No problem.  Also no trial.  Funny that.	And was allowed to dismiss his own case.	0
1	No the question was actually very unambiguously "no black people"   https://imgur.com/MvG1Ni3.jpg  It's right there, probably don't even need to scroll up.	Sorry.  I should have been clearer.  There are definitely POC in LOTR.  But they do not include Hobbits or Elves.	0
1	Yep dems allow legal votes from absentee ballots.	During a pandemic where in-person interaction was recommended by health officials to be minimized.  I voted by mail in our election (Canada). It was easy, safe, and secure.	0
1	Freedom is slavery	Ignorance is strength	0
1	He’s a racist. He didn’t want to breathe the air of a black person	Yeah, he won't arrest or charge them either.	0
1	And a completely failed execution, brought to you by Joe “you ain’t black” Biden.	Dude has been in office for barely 8 months.that’s like a restaurant manager destroying a restaurant then when they hire a new guy, blaming him for why things are fucked.	0
1	Freedom of assembly is the right to hold public meetings or gatherings without the government interfering. Slavery wouldn't violate that right	It absolutely would. If your literal owner doesn't want you going to that meeting, are you still allowed to go? No. Violation of your right.	1
1	I think it depends on the Republican. I know of some Republicans as well as Democrats that are monsters, and that's a fact. A group can only do so much, it's up to the people to decide what they're actions are and how it affects others in the long run.	All republicans are monsters, most democrats are also monsters.  Being trans in America is miserable.  Treat us as equals, gives is rights, and leave us alone.  Thanks.	0
1	The same reason there were negro leagues. So people can participate in a sport with fair(er) representation	Dude… the Negro leagues existed because black players were prohibited from playing in the major leagues.	1
1	&gt; What about lynching makes it a "hate crime"?  Well, most lynchings happened because of skin color more than anything else. They'd falsely accuse a black person of a crime and then just kill them.	Okay, but that's not what a lynching is. It's just a hanging without a trial. Nothing in the meaning of the word "lynching" has anything to do with race.	0
1	Bull shit democrats are pussies, more democrats have died than Republicans.	Fortunately the vast majority of those who remain are not as braindead as the Trumpublicans who perished because they listened to the Mango Mussolini.	0
1	Is he black?  Maybe he's self conscious about being ashy.  Some of us get real ashy.	He's so ashy that he has to jump up and slather on lotion immediately? Is anyone really THAT ashy?  LMAO!!  The whole thing is hilarious!	0
1	Bet you also thing the Black Power fist iconography is racist too, but Proud Boys throwing up the okay hand sign is just “boys being boys,” huh?	Sure don’t. But you did a great job furthering an actual discussion. 🙄	0
1	I will never get over how CRT has become a catch-all word for Republicans' gripes they've had for decades with race politics.	Why is this being taught to 4 year olds? Anti racist baby? Seriously?	0
1	Incredible the state didn't pursue a case against Wanetta Gibson for false accusations.	They went after her to recover the money and scholarship she got. Idk whether anything was ever recovered at all.	0
1	If you can't accept the fact that people of color have been discriminated against, and there is a well established structure of white supremacy in this country...you don't deserve to graduate.	Please let me clarify, I have never ever thought that there wasn’t discrimination. Ever	0
1	The Democrats DID leave the filibuster in place for SCOTUS nominees.  They removed it for lower court nominees in 2013, setting the precedent for the Republicans to remove it for SCOTUS nominees 4 years later.  What goes around comes around.	Why was it removed? Obstruction.	0
1	You REALLY want to see the right lose their sh\*t? Michelle Obama does have a Law degree from Harvard. And she is the smart one.	That’s the dumbest shit I have ever heard.	0
1	Because I Was High by Afroman da da dut dut duh	I had to look deep for this	0
1	Do you believe there are no qualified black women?  That's what you are suggesting if you are upset about it.	No that does not undermine anyone.   What undermines someone is when you come out and say I’m only going to pick a certain race & gender. You undermine every other race and the opposite gender with that one statement.	0
1	Anyone have any “plot centered” recommendations? I actually recently finished the first book in the Black Dagger Brotherhood series, Dark Lover. It’s like twilight but XXX lol it wasn’t bad, I’m just looking for a more realistic story/plot.	Fever Series by Karen Marie Moning.	0
1	I don't think meme is the word you are looking for. And it's only racist if it's used the right way. Used as an insulting name for a black radical racist it's not racist, it's just funny like calling a Klansman Cracker McCrackerson.	Rastus is racist too. Idk what you're going for with "it's just a funny name, it's not racist." It can be both of those things.	0
1	Yeah no, false allegations are very real. Ask the black man who spent 15 years in prison on the word of a white woman who then founded her writing career on that.	Of course racist white women are gonna use the #metoo movement to their advantage and feminists are gonna play stupid and act like they don’t know why	0
1	Yes the Democrats know that well, their litmus test for judges is their willingness to enforce liberal positions rather than written law.	Can you show me any proof?  The Supreme Court is a 6-3 super majority for conservatives despite conservatives only only making up 40% of the country.	0
1	I wont say Republicans have compassion or a functioning brain either.	The ones that have neither aren't the ones you need to worry about. They just flail around and prove to be ineffective. It's the ones that only lack compassion that you need to look out for.	0
1	Most black people are killed by black people. According to your logic these victims aren't victims because they are also black.  You should can that train of thought and try to become a better human.	Most white people are killed by white people   What’s your point?  In fact, the fact that men are the primary perpetrators of violence transcends race, class and culture   Textbook whataboutism, and a dumb af one at that	0
1	It’s a small town thing in my experience. There are residual pains from Jim Crow, and insulated government that doesn’t care much. America isn’t racist. But there are scars.	Yeah, that's what I was thinking when I wrote my post.	0
1	Right. No one says "Why didn't anyone say '54% of crimes are commited by 13% of population' in that Blacks rights event." because it's racist.	That's not racist. Racism is judging people by their skin color. Wake up	0
1	“Stereotypes” are based off truth. I didn’t say black people, just black girls. Facts can’t be racist	Keep telling yourself you’re not racist. Not all black girls are loud.   Stereotypes are not based on facts. They are based on “widely held but fixed and oversimplified image or idea of a particular type of person or thing.”   But good try.	1
1	Instead, they try to make it so Republicans can't make a living...	How so?	0
1	It's not being debated, click into the article and read why they voted no. They all think lynching is a terrible crime.	Ohh do they? And the fact that they’re talking about a century old extrajudicial punishment, trying to decide if it’s a hate crime, IS debating the subject.	0
1	They hate their own. Kamala Harris is responsible for indicting the most African-Americans in her District than any other prosecutor she also withheld evidence of an innocent African-American on death row.	Yeah neither of those are true.	0
1	Plenty of Democrats won't admit they dislike him to a pollster in order not to give Republicans a "win".	From what I’ve seen a lot of them are actually okay admitting they hate the old b*stard. The response I tend to get when I ask is ‘at least he isn’t trump.’	0
1	People color refer to themselves as people of color.   White is a blank canvas.   It's not that crazy.	It's a (miss)quote from a movie.  Don't remember which move tbh.  Just thought it was appropriate to the subject...	0
1	Their facts aren't necessarily wrong, but their interpretation is laughable. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Yet, there is no evidence of any black population in medieval England.	>Yet, there is no evidence of any black population in medieval England.  You realize falsifying this statement would require the verifiable presence of literally one black person in medieval England, yes?	0
1	Slave is not one I’ve used before. Making a mental note. Thanks.	No prob.	0
1	&gt; In my country the left line of the motor bus is reserved for the women  Substitute women with black people and you have a nation-wide riot on your hands	No, there wouldn't be. The woman in that scenario also has full access to the bus. Replace women with either men or white people and then there is an issue. It all depends on who it benefits.	0
1	Except Kentucky is ran by the democrats	Why don't you respond to this? 38 state senators - 8 Democrats.  100 state representatives- 25 Democrats	0
1	For a real black tie event a suit is wrong as well.	Women or femme presenting people can get away with a properly fitted suit for black tie. Traditional wear for men is a bit more formal though.	0
1	So no Black person or Latino can get an id?	You do actually have to click and read it. When you do that we can talk.	0
1	Very true. But if the “being wrong” bit is intentionally misrepresenting and altering data to portray black people as genetically inferior then it’s both wrong AND racist	Ok, well prove it. If you can't, you can't claim its racist.	0
1	We did that. Democrats control the Presidency and both houses of Congress, and *still* nothing happens. What's your next excuse?	Easy. The dickholes from W Virginia and Arizona who need not be named. Any other questions?	0
1	When Republicans go on and on about”freedom” and “liberty” they mean they want to take it from others.	Democrat?	0
1	The script has flipped and for the first time ever Republicans are the cool rebellious kids sticking it to the man.	No, according to the media we are still assholes.  No matter what we do we are the bad guys because only Democrats can do what’s right.	0
1	But they say it’s the Democrats that are committing fraud. By now we’ve seen more Republicans caught committing fraud than any other political party.	Who cares what they say. Justice is being obstructed on behalf of Republicans.  They are destroying our democracy.	0
1	Texas : I’m not purple because the red guys in charge keep inventing new ways to prevent the blues voters from voting.	Painfully untrue. If you want to vote, go vote. It’s that simple here	0
1	If black lives matter, and all lives don't, what other conclusion would a reasonable person come to?	This reminds of that guy who shot at BLM protesters while screaming "all lives matter"  If you're using "all lives matter" only to condemn someone then you don't actually mean it.	0
1	I never said it was easy. All I said was that it wasn't necessarily permanent like being black is.	You make it seem as if you can just go get a job and an apartment. You should educate yourself and find a bit of empathy.	0
1	Democrats could vote to enshrine Roe v. Wade literally any day of the week but they won't.  They didn't under Obama with enormous margins in the Senate, and they certainly won't do so now.    The Democrats are useless.	>Democrats could vote to enshrine Roe v. Wade literally any day of the week  False.	0
1	His Twitter account was awesome.  He would say something to enrage the left, and while the media was covering Twitter, Republicans were making the country great again.	Yeah so great that a record number of people voted against him.	0
1	Republicans are radical right wing nuts and so are you if you support them fr	At this point I think you can even leave out "radical right wing".  The lesson they seemed to learn from Trump is to just provoke all the time.	0
1	But still she was approved to depict the character in the movie, then after that the AUTHOR said the character was black. So which description is it?	Giving approval to a black actress playing her is not the same as saying she's black. It kinda shows the race detail is irrelevant.	0
1	You do if you vote Republican.	The study I linked above suggests otherwise.	0
1	Had a black guy in my squad in the army with a confederate flag tat. When asked why he always answered "Because I'm from Georgia" as if the question was silly. Still left me a bit confused but to each their own.	People have been led to believe it is a "racist flag" just because it is used by a bad group of people. It has different meanings to different people.	0
1	Republicans wouldn't care about something like that.  If 2020 proved anything, it proved we did have a choice. It might not be one we like, but we can make one.	The choice we got said “nothing would fundamentally change” and it hasn’t. This isn’t winning.	0
1	Ah yes, those racists that elected both a black female and cuban to prominent positions in Virginia.  The left really is delusional.	I love the barely-hidden hatred the left has for Cubans for the crime of having first hand experience with a far left economic system.  You should have seen the posts from Florida leftists when we went red this election.	0
1	As the article points out, Republicans have a history of being told to redraw maps in North Carolina. If they can't draw fair maps then the party shouldn't be allowed to take part in the next election.   No reason why AI isn't drawing these at this point	Both sides do it bud.	0
1	Bet this guy only votes for Democrats.	No doubt!	0
1	Really? Goldwater was a presidential candidate in **the 1960's**	Yes but half a decade ago is 5 years.	0
1	This is literally all I’ve seen from him. It’s like local boomer that has to assure everyone that his black face was just jokes	He's clearly not old enough to remember comedians used to get arrested for being offensive and now you get rewarded for going over the line.   I like him when he's not being insecure and just focuses on the laughs.	0
1	Wow, you couldn't answer honestly. By your logic that means you support that exception for marital rape *and* you support herding black people into concentration camps.  You are really, really bad at this.	Lol. Yes yes. The 'I'll make outlandish claims to distract from a real debate' mentality. I guess making said outlandish claims is far easier than rational discussion.	0
1	Autonomous cars have their own issues - such as [being racist.](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/news/self-driving-car-crash-racial-bias-black-people-study-a8810031.html)	I looked for a satire tag. No luck. But everything is racist now.	0
1	The only ones ever caught with election fraud were Republicans, but keep up with that lie if it makes you feel better	Ask your middle-school civics teacher what ballot privacy is.	0
1	For me its just wierd that the whole left just has to baby every minority possible. And they always has to be on top. It's racist imo. I mean just the whole "white mam bad black man good. Look at how they see Obama and how they talk about white presidents.	Woke culture is anti racists but really they are racist themselves.	0
1	Lmao who refers to poor black people as white trash? Gtfo with that BS.	It was an EPA term referring to waste found in yards. Any racist connotations were inferred by an ignorant populace. Nice illustration of your ignorance, though.	0
1	You can bet your ass if the situation was reversed, Republicans would be putting extreme pressure on DOJ both publicly and privately.	Yeah just look at how they responded to losing an election	0
1	And that child would still be considered black.  For example - the rapper Krondon who plays Tobias Whale in The CW’s “Black Lightning”.	The same way intersex r either male or female with genetic anomalies,so i dont understand why u put them in a special cathegory.  Its like saying blacks, asians, whites and albinos	0
1	For that to happen it would require a Republican Party with a spine.  To be honest I haven’t ever seen that in my lifetime.	Gingrich was coming in hot in 1994 during the days of the Gingrich Revolution / Republican Revolution. The Republican Party had a backbone for about 2 years, we need that again even just for 2 years.	0
1	Every governor should be taking notes from DeSantis.	I think the Governor's in red states should be taking notes.	0
1	Blacksburg is at the other end of VA from DC.	I will acknowledge my ignorance there.  I just know a lot of government contractors and such that work there.	0
1	At the end of the day, judges need to be appointed.  Democrats held more power therefore the GOP was being obstructionist as the Democrats didn’t actually need the GOP’s approval which is why the circuit court filibuster was removed	I ask again, is it obstructionism when Democrats hold up republican majority policy and appointments? Also, that argument applies rather well to McConnel. He didnt need the Democrats approval and the GOP held more power	0
1	3.5 is a starting point.  Republicans coming to the table and doing their jobs would bring that down.	Or we could bring it down to zero if they do their jobs and obstruct.	0
1	Could you link this The Black Lives Matter organization? I am aware of a decentralized movement, but I can't seem to find any sort of organization one could investigate.	https://blacklivesmatter.com  The main one is called Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation. That’s the one through which much of the donated money flowed	0
1	So if you are black and you dont buy into their “black people are oppressed” shit, you aren’t really black.	And you will actually be oppressed	0
1	It looks like the black guy shoves her first, but w/e.	She got into his personal space, he pushed her away and then slaps him. His response after the fact was perfectly rational. You white folks are a piece of work…	0
1	What's crazy is Republicans say the same shit out Democrats	While literally banning books in the very same breath. And all of it, the confusions, the actions, the fucked up accusations and insane viewpoints, etc., *it is all by design*.	0
1	The sometimes rational Republicans and the bat shit crazy q Republicans ate about to have it out in Georgia.	It’s harder and harder to find a “rational” Republican who didn’t participate in either the birther garbage or stop the steal fraud. I’d argue there is no such thing as a good Republican.	0
1	And even in the rare cases when they are charged just one Republican on the jury means they will not be convicted.	Notification or nullification ?	0
1	Eskimo sisters	They've all been inside you?	0
1	And take reasons why racist people say they’re afraid of black people and replace black people with men and you have feminists being afraid of men	Oof I though I would be hard to come up with a dumber take than the last guy. God damn. You did it.	1
1	All black people have to have the same beliefs   You're right, there's nothing racist with this line of logic at all.	At this point it's a meme that racists larp as black people use the opening "as a black man".	0
1	Every President in your lifetime is a war criminal	I meant every POTUS. If not that, then a shitty person.	0
1	I still don’t understand that shift. How did the south become the Republican Party so fast? The Civil Rights act had bipartisan support - the split was very clearly between north and south.	Unfortunately, It really is as simple as….racism. After/during the civil rights act The Democratic Party absorbed what would have been the “black party”. And the Southern dixiecrats ran to the Republican Party.	0
1	Texas will stop it. Republicans only believe in local control if they’re the ones doing the controlling.	I feel, at the very least, this is a way to take away a woman's right to vote, without repealing the 19th Amendment. Give them a felony conviction, no more voting. It's insidious.	0
1	No surprise. These are the same types that insist they aren't racist because they once had a black friend in the military or college. Over 30 years ago. They'll act like decent human beings once and ride it for the remainder of their lives.	Or friends with a black coworker, aka someone they were paid to interact with, but never saw outside work.	0
1	So typical......don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. Maybe that little felon should get a participation trophy	Statue incoming	0
1	In some cases it's you're not black so you're ineligible.	It doesn't make the Black recipients any less deserving. They take the best candidates that are equally as good or better than any other ethnicity could've been	0
1	Republicans can’t bring themselves to do the right thing. Ever.	i take offense at that. Im a republican and I did the right thing! (became a democrat)	0
1	I think that the context of Harvard being under fire for affirmative action is pertinent. Thomas went to Yale. Maybe the question would come up, but it doesn't have the same dog whistle that a black Harvard Law attendee does.	Alright let’s up the ante and say Thomas went to Harvard. Do you think *then* Tucker would question his qualifications?	0
1	The Republican party is in a state of permanent ignorance, at least those that survive.	Don't look up!	0
1	Find out where Kanye West was last night	or Jusssey Swallowit or however you spell his name lol	0
1	And Josh Duggar was convicted too. It’s been a good few weeks.	Let's not soon forget Virginia. Seems like that was what started the recent wave of justice	0
1	Slavery is objectively bad, though.	Read the link I posted, Slavery is not objectively bad and the meaning of it changes drastically through history	0
1	She's got more credibility and experience than Kavanaugh and Barrett combined, Republicans have nothing if they don't have theatrics.	She's also neither an unstable alcoholic nor a religious cult member like Kavanaugh and Barrett respectively.	0
1	God, the right is *so* stupid. You think you’re just so clever…. Just say the actual phrase. Republicans don’t have the balls to say they hate Biden.   /CLEARLYSARCASM	You’re worse than Sotomayor when it comes to due diligence. I’ll even give you a hint: it’s a double-entrende.	0
1	All Republicans of course. /s	That's what they actually mean when they talk about white supremacists. If you like Trump then you're automatically a WS.	0
1	Yes but the term African american is for black people born in America not any type of african	Huh, turns out you're actually right via the legal definition.  >African Americans are citizens or residents of the United States who have origins in any of the black populations of Africa.  I guess he's just an American from Africa lol.	0
1	Democrats would gain more political traction in America (where the system is really set up badly for them to win) if they concentrated on class rather than race.   It wouldn’t solve all racial issues but it would solve more than not winning would.	The last thing Democrats want is increased class consciousness	0
1	Anyone who says "both sides" is a Republican trying to get Democratic voters to stay home instead of voting.	I say "Both sides" Shit many times for Democrats being hypocrites and cowards for not getting shit done.     However, I never once say that Democrats are just as bad as Republicans. One party wants me dead, the other party just disappoints me.	0
1	At that point cops need to be involved If he is that bad	That’s probably a pretty big ask.	0
1	We had a black president. What are you talking about?	And almost half the country tried to claim he wasn't a real American.	0
1	Yes. The police have apprehended a black man and charged him with her crime. Open and shut case.	After he was handcuffed they also popped 3 on his back since he breathed aggressively at the cops.	0
1	Republicans love restrictive government... Fucking weirdos	But they love to scream we need less government restrictions.	0
1	So a black, BLM protestor can sit on the jury and convict Chauvin but this juror can’t make a joke?	A joke not about the defendant or the assailants.  I don't see how it's relevant to Kyle's case.  Ridiculous.	0
1	“Race tax”?  Reparations aren’t something white people owe to black people. It’s something the United States of America owes to the dependents of slaves.	Reparations  would have to be payed with tax money. We would then need to find said money probably in the form of a tax increase on everyone else so yes a race tax.	0
1	Taking bets that Republicans will impeach Biden in 2023.	If republicans have the house an impeachment is inevitable. Maybe even 3 impeachments just to outdo the number Trump got.	0
1	Good point. I wish there was a way for voters to decide how many Democrat and Republicans get in the Senate.	Why do cows in Wisconsin get more representation than I do?	0
1	Apparently….no.  https://www.politico.com/story/2007/01/black-caucus-whites-not-allowed-002389	Ever hear of the white woman, "transracial" Rachel Dolezal? She was a chapter president.	0
1	Democrats Telling people of Color "Your to poor or stupid to have ID" . Sounds like Stereotyping and Racist in a purist form. For sure people of Color should be OUTRAGED to be viewed in this manner.	That's (D)ifferent	0
1	Pretty sure Willie Brown was rock bottom…	I think he gave her a rock bottom, right onto his water bed	0
1	Asking the soldier if he has any leftover black cammy stick?	Ugh, you beat me by 10 min	0
1	Of course a Republican is dodging taxes.	He's a democrat.	0
1	That's because he wants a bigger bill to address more than just safe banking. Republicans are trying to give handouts to big tobacco and other companies to swoop in and overtake the Industry.	He's not going to that bigger bill and he knows it. What could be hashed out largely has been hashed out. This is letting the perfect be the enemy of good.	0
1	Democrats could vote to enshrine Roe v. Wade literally any day of the week but they won't.  They didn't under Obama with enormous margins in the Senate, and they certainly won't do so now.    The Democrats are useless.	Dems don't because they need it as a single voter issue to get votes. I bet de politicians are jumping up and down happy about this because it will help keep from losing their seat this November.	0
1	Burning a cross and running around town with a lynch mob looking for blacks. Crazy.	that's still ok in the us isnt it?	0
1	Election is only 4 days away. Youngkin appears to be peaking at the right time. Of course Democrats may "find" ballots sometime late on election night.	He'll be ahead by a million votes at midnight and somehow lose by a few thousand votes in the morning. I'd like to believe these poll numbers, but I don't have faith in the electoral process after what happened last year.	0
1	Excuse me, female African American Supreme Court judge. My apologies	Ketanji Jackson is the first black woman to be nominated- so I’m still not sure what you’re referring to.	0

1	NIgga its one of the 6 pillars of Iman	brother please speak appropriately. Jazakallah	1
1	Democrats could vote to enshrine Roe v. Wade literally any day of the week but they won't.  They didn't under Obama with enormous margins in the Senate, and they certainly won't do so now.    The Democrats are useless.	They dont have the votes in the Senate.  Looking at you Manchin and Sinema.	0
1	It’s just saying ‘Owen Brown is spending the rest of his life with me’, don’t know how that is black magic that is supposed to affect me..?	>Owen Brown  The only Owen Brown I know of is the son of John Brown, the abolitionist	0
1	Didn’t even know it was token diversity. I thought it was just a black elf	This actually cracked me up	0
1	South African blacks say hi.	Oh my bad I didn’t realize this topic was about South Africa. I thought the US was the focus, but I’ll leave you guys to it.	0
1	I'm not sure you're on the most solid ground if you're arguing that the Chapelle Show was equivalent to blackface.	Dressing up, lightening one's face, and mocking funny stereotypes? I'd say it's the same. It's also still funny.	0
1	Alabama legislature tries something illegal. What's new?	There's nothing illegal about this law though. California ignores federal immigration law and Colorado with marijuana.	0
1	Democrats are right-wingers and right-wingers love corruption.	Okay, tankie.	0
1	Hopefully it bit mostly Democrats.	I don't know if wishing Rabies on someone is a good look.	0

1	At this rate they’ll get it. The GOP haven’t won the popular vote in almost two decades.	The GOP have won just 1 popular vote of the last 10. That was Bush in 2004, and the 10 elections dates back to 1980. They're a dying party with over representation.	0
1	Kentucky has a law that says a bail amount must be set	Do they typically set it at 100k for attempted murder?	0
1	Alternatively, we need to stop shoving conservative-lite democrats down peoples throats as the only alternative to the GOP.	Who is doing the shoving? It seems to me that if the voters want more progressives, they would vote in more progressives.  We need to spend more time educating our fellow Americans because that is the real power(as Fox News has figured out).	0
1	Suppose they will just spin it, he only did it cause they have Democratic governor.	Ok, so we follow the logic one deeper, then. Why would a Democratic governor help a rural county in his state of which the vast majority did not vote for him?	0
1	If the under-counting had hurt blue states, Democrats would already be launching Congressional investigations and DOJ probes into the matter.  The GOP needs to do the same.	https://www.nbcchicago.com/news/local/illinois-undercounted-in-2020-census-actually-grew-to-13-million-the-states-largest-population-ever/2837753/	0
1	No. The FBI was colluding with the Democratic Party. You can’t be manipulated if you believe the same shit.	Anyone leeching off tax dollars for a living should be audited and given psych evaluations on a yearly basis. We have actual communist meetings happening in our government. Paid for with US tax dollars 😭	0
1	She ain't black /s	Probably what Biden said to himself after watching her on TV.	0
1	Clown. Individual action changes nothing for anybody ever. Lol. You think you have workers rights if you did not have unions? Or Black people would have rights in the USA if they did not band together?  You are on the wrong sub	Yet, we as men still need to avoid the victim mindset, which is easy to fall into, especially if you are not a 6ft2 Chad Chadington.	0
1	I don't think any white person would ever word it like that lmao, even I assumed this person is black based on that wording.	okay 👍	0
1	Just like y'all city's taking over for more then a 100 day as police station burned and you Democrat want to defund the police at least the police was there only because you Democrat haven't taken over Texas yet	Can you repeat this in English?	0
1	But the ordering or announcement appears racist.  X will be a black women  Vs  We have 3 good canadites and chose x, who happens to be a black women  Massive difference in optics	Racist against whom?	0
1	So a black, BLM protestor can sit on the jury and convict Chauvin but this juror can’t make a joke?	Clearly the last judge was biased against Chauvin. This judge is going completely by the book and this was the correct thing to do.	0
1	When I moved to Oregon when I was 11.  I came from a predominantly black city and moving to one of whitest was a huge culture shock.	It's always amazing to me how young boys figure out that they are being short changed.  In your case it seems race was a big factor.  But reports are that boys around 12 have already figured out the game is rigged in the UK.	0
1	In five years every Democrat will claim that they were always opposed to mask mandates, the lockdowns and forced vaccinations.  They will claim it was a subset of members that flipped to the Republican party.	The parties have flipped in the past 10 years	0
1	I wonder how much the Democrats paid her to "remember" this event from many many years ago that she forgot to mention.	Like the paid fake “victim” chicks in the Kavanaugh fiasco that were proved liars.	0
1	If that's the case, and because I'm such a badass,  I'll take three pens.	Three? Lightweight.  I'll take fifteen pens.  I'll even get a nickname. Mr PEN15. I'll be known throughout the world. Leave your pen unattended? Suffer the wrath of Mr PEN15!	0

1	Maybe, just maybe, those are symptoms of disenfranchisement? You know for a fact she would never say anything like that regarding African-American crime statistics	>a lot of female perpetrators are almost never recognized  Nanny Doss had to kill about a dozen of her family members before someone suspected her. Had she been male, the alarm bells would have rung on the second or third victim.	0
1	Democrats Telling people of Color "Your to poor or stupid to have ID" . Sounds like Stereotyping and Racist in a purist form. For sure people of Color should be OUTRAGED to be viewed in this manner.	Too. Than. Regardless. Irrespective.  It’s ironic when a person says another person is to stupid or two stupid.	0
1	If you really wanted diversity you wouldn't be asking for a black woman, as black people are already proportionally represented on the court.	Black men are, sure.	0
1	Bet this guy only votes for Democrats.	Probably a BLM supporter too.	0
1	As a black person I can honestly say no one cares	As a black man you should know we are not one monolithic group and that one person cannot speak or act for that group.	0
1	He shot at a Democrat by the way.  Not that it matters. He tried to assassinate a mayoral candidate.	And he still got bail at 100k, the judge should have made the bail $999,999k	0
1	But now people who aren’t Republicans are complaining. So why not just do the not stupid thing and keep your intentions private and let your actions speak for themselves?  Just nominate a black woman, you don’t need to tell everyone beforehand.	There’s no legislative successes he has to tout, so he’s gotta fire up his SJW base some how	0
1	Yeah cause Biden said he was gonna pick a black woman. Making it affirmative action.	I have a question for you.   Do you think in this country a black woman who can admirably perform the duties of SC justice duties in a competent and fair manner exists?	0
1	Yet somehow Democrats will sing her praises for it.	Democrats don’t hold public servants up like gods…that’s another party…	0
1	Suddenly Black Lives Matter don’t matter to the left. In my neck of the woods ALL LIVES MATTER	What I noticed too from an outsider perspective, the over-use of the word black from the left, whilst everytime I heard Trump speak, all I heard was "Americans". The left love to purposely divide everyone then blame it on others.	0
1	He's clearly not an idiot.   And "thug" is just the word racists use when they're too scared to use the n-word.	It doesn't seem to me that being an idiot prevents you from being successful  >And "thug"  What are you talking about? He's a self proclaimed gangster.	0
1	Republicans: fund copious amounts of money into standardized testing and cut teacher wages  Republicans: "wtffffffff why aren't kids learning???????????"	Republicans didn’t educate this kid his entire life and then graduate him not being able to read.	0
1	Republicans are so out of touch that they are trying desperately to turn back the block, only aiding in the unification of a grand oposition to their inhumane machinations.	They are going to win the midterms. There is no grand opposition.	0
1	Texas will stop it. Republicans only believe in local control if they’re the ones doing the controlling.	Austin is the state capital. The city could make life hell for the state government if they wanted to.	0
1	I'm not black, so I don't claim to own their movement.	I’m trying to co opt our(I guess) movement because frankly this matters more.	0
1	Are you American? That person would be called mixed or biracial or half-black. In my case, it’s not evenly half and half, so I’m partially black. This is the common term.	You should really include that you’re mixed race in your OP	0
1	Probably just going to get another Democrat replacing him	That's the problem with NY. The person replacing him is just as bad.	0
1	Virginia was SUPER close. Youngkin only won 50.6% of the vote. We were less than a percentage point away from having a very different next four years.	Letting boys going into girls bathrooms and rape girls is a bad look for the left.	0

1	So slavery?	But with options!	0
1	I don’t subscribe to “both sides” nonsense.  It implies that there is some balance there, when truly, Republicans are damn near insane.  Specifically, bothsidesism is called False Balance.	Bothsideism is valid when talking about cable news. I understand how vile conservative cable news pundits may appear to you, but they do the exact same thing their liberal counterparts do on the opposite side of issues.	0
1	Two “strong” black men with the ideology of “I got mine, sucks for you” and “white supremacy doesn’t mean we can’t be friends”.  They already deny climate change	Happy Cake Day!	0
1	Are you saying black men are more "self aware" than white men?  How does that follow?	Nope, I only commented on white men, following the OP without trying to muddy the waters or otherwise disrail the subject.	0
1	where did you hear that Reaux is black?	Because she’s said so? Quite a few times on the podcast. She has a black woman profile avatar on social media. I think you guys are confusing Reaux with Lillith….?	0
1	It makes perfect sense. The Republicans have already promised at least 7 investigations against the Democrats when they take power next year. Come back and see if I’m complaining when the Dems stonewall those	Okay, let's have a little law and order.  No one is above the law...  So what are these, pardon the phrase, Trumped up investigations?	0
1	Majority of title IX expelled students are young black men which were not given due process. They are reenforcing the same mob lynching culture against black men as it used to be in 20th century.

1	Yup Democrats didn’t support keeping slaves/s	Or concentration camps and gulags /sarcasm	0
1	Should I be fwendz with more Black's this time ?	You shouldn’t be a racist piece of shit period. Be friends with people who are friendly with you which in your case is probably a very exclusive club.	1
1	Is it possible to learn such constitutional power??........... Not from a Democrat.	Does that mean Joe Manchin is going to a 720 degree spin from the prone position on the Senate Floor and switch parties?	0
1	??? I’m confused. Are you saying that hating qualities of Jewish culture simply because they are Jewish qualities doesn’t make you anti Semitic? So basically hating how black people sound isn’t anti black? This is what you’re saying?	No I'm saying virtue signalling idiots who can't string together a cogent argument just defer to raysism as their go to. He doesn't like Sarah Silverman because she's terrible not because she's Jewish	0
1	She could be a literal beholder who eats the aids on live TV and as long as there is an R next to her name, the Republicans will give their support.	Exactly	0
1	Republicans are not interested in solutions. They're interested in problems that they can campaign off of.	To be fair, so do democrats. They may talk like they want to help everyone, but they will always make sure they can get re-elected first.	0
1	But they say it’s the Democrats that are committing fraud. By now we’ve seen more Republicans caught committing fraud than any other political party.	Projection.  It makes investigating them really easy.  What ever they say democrats are doing, that IS what they are doing.	0
1	You don't joke about people losing their hair to a disease.   Not because they're black, or a woman, but because that's completely disgusting to bully *anyone* about.	Seriously? You know how many people are losing their hair? That’s a pretty easy joke. If someone has cancer, sure, maybe it’s not really cool to make strong jokes about that. But this isn’t really the end of the world.	0
1	Republicans are about to be faced with the hard reality of *getting what they want and having not planned on that*.	Don’t they just pin it on the minority anyway? Population will skyrocket and they will blame promiscuous illegal immigrants, allowing them to pass laws that bar their access to healthcare and sanctuary.	0
1	It wouldn’t?  He’d just be a black guy instead of a white guy.	Would he still be a cool outlaw or perceived as a “thug”	0
1	Why does it seem to be only Republicans committing voter fraud.	Because it is only Republicans committing voter fraud. Every fraud case from this last election was all Republican voters.	0
1	What are they gonna do, vote Republican? -Dems about blue collar workers in the Midwest and Appalachia	My grandparents were Democrats until they retired and no longer benefited from unions, and until Obama got the nomination. Wonder why. They both now primarily listen to Tucker Carlson.	0
1	Don't talk to this guy again, do not associate with people who do black magic, it is considered shirk.	He’s very clingy unfortunately, I’m trying to limit communications so he gets the message	0
1	Especially the over-woke white activist or politician who says that if they do something that said activist/politician doesn't like then "You ain't Black". Essentially acting as a condescending gatekeeper for other races.	How dare you call him white, he's jewish	0
1	[It came out that she constantly bashes black men and these tears are for the white guys who didn't choose her](https://twitter.com/Tosci_Marie/status/1490436031950299138?t=xkUPdTYc756WsVSQgmeBqg&amp;s=19)	Knew it.  I knew she was hamstringing herself *somehow* with some kind of loony standard.	0
1	The Democrats DID leave the filibuster in place for SCOTUS nominees.  They removed it for lower court nominees in 2013, setting the precedent for the Republicans to remove it for SCOTUS nominees 4 years later.  What goes around comes around.	Your right, I stand corrected.	0
1	Republicans and their voters support the violent overthrow of the American system of government.	All because they can't handle the fact that a man can marry another man and that a black man served as President.  It all comes down to that.	0
1	Texas will stop it. Republicans only believe in local control if they’re the ones doing the controlling.	The thing is you cant just "stop" it.  It is a good move because the state then has to fogure out how to enforce the law itself when city officials wont.	0
1	White children (even the poor and/or poorly behaved ones) are less likely to be punished / suspended / expelled from school than children of color (even in cases where both groups of children did the same thing).	That sounds like some kind of study can you post à link?	0
1	75% Democrat as well.	That’s what he said… racist elite white people.	0
1	Thats interesting. The whites originated from England and Europe and they bought the blacks.   By his measure, the only ones that should stay are the only American Indians.	Yes. To quote Jack White, "Why don't you kick yourself out, you're an immigrant too."	0
1	Not if Republicans retake the house.	Not after Republicans retake the house.  &#x200B;  Fixed it for you.	0

No way.  How about we just acknowledge there are shitty people out there, without labelling their gender or race?	0
1	If the Republicans win the House, this human embodiment of poor judgment will be Judiciary Chair.	We're looking at elections where even more people's lives are on the line than usual.	0
1	Thats why you have proper training.  Making it more difficult to buy and possess firearms will simply make that more difficult along with lack of quality control from black markets.	Which is it are you in favor of mandatory training or not?	0
1	It amazes me that left-leaning people in this subreddit are happy about him losing.  He'd be easier to beat in the general election.  Even if he wins the general election, he helps tar the Republicans' image and helps Democrats win other races.	> He'd be easier to beat in the general election.  Ah, the 'let's hope Trump wins the Republican primary' theory of 2016.	0
1	Republicans need to make sure it’s a 1/2 term by impeaching AND removing him!	Why? So we can get Kamala instead? Get a grip man, joe is pretty terrible but he's better than what might come next.	0
1	Republicans who paid a washed up actress/model to complain about a staged photo with Al Franken, and got him to resign, have no problems with Gaetz having sex with underaged girls.	>Gaetz having sex with underaged **girls**.  Oh is he into girls now?	0
1	He's got an R next to his name. He could have shot those kids himself, shit on the floor, and fucked the wife of every man in Texas and they'd still vote him in to uproarious applause.	Oh he’s fucking all their wives all right. And their moms and daughters.	0
1	Pretty sure it is here actually, we have pretty strict (like second most strict in the world) tobacco laws. With thankfully makes for a thriving black market	Haha i'm sure :D well i only know it kinda started up here in Skandinavia. But since it is a pretty good substitute for cigarettes, Im not surprised it has spread all over :P	0
1	What about when a man goes to the police with a black eye?	Telling him men should be taught not to be violent wouldn't be good. Obviously.	0
1	It really is crazy, I had an old coworker tell me how awful it was that black people were moving in to our town.	My mother who is near 80 is upset that her great-grandchildren will be the minorities in the future. She says it out loud . . . but she's not racist!	0
1	The Civil Rights Act was pretty good to begin with, and most of the welfare programs succeeded the first time around.	> The Civil Rights Act  Which one? There have been [eight](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_Rights_Act)  > most of the welfare programs succeeded the first time around  Absolute nonsense.	0
1	The civil rights act is not on the ballots	The legislators who vote for or against it are.  And there were similar laws on ballots at state levels.  Other issues on ballots have included civil rights as well whether it be marriage or women's rights.	0
1	If you can't grift off dumbasses, what's the point in being a Republican?	Culture wars and strawman arguments?	0
1	He is the one doing black magic on you. There is nothing wrong with you. All those practices he is telling you to do can be black magic, completely cut off any contact with him asap.	Don't listen to the ruqya either, it might have satanic verses If he is doing black magic. Read the real quran and ruqya from actual scholars.	0
1	This was the Democrat plan long before covid, they LOVE segregation.	I mean they kept segregation going for another nintety years after the Civil War with Jim Crow laws. I wouldn't be surprised if the Democrats want to install another modern version of segregation but with vaccines in mind.	0
1	If you watch the video there is a dude trapped dead to rights and he knows it.  He is screaming his death scream.  The shooter just says "you're Allright "  Dude was white.  All the black people though?  Double tapped.	Half the people he shot on the video were white	0
1	Nobody spends money on Black Friday; we all save money because of the fabulous discounts!	Yes. The more you buy, the more you save.	0

1	Thankfully, the poor old woman trampled by blackface-hitler's gestapo thugs merely suffered a dislocated shoulder and is recovering in hospital.	Dude Ted Cruz wasn't riding the horse.	0
1	If a liberal state was actively discriminating against African Americans like FL no they wouldn’t, but good try I guess	That the state would need “preclearence” would never fly in any state. It’s also setting a bad president for more ruling like this. Regardless of what was going on in Florida, the federal government should have no say in state elections.	0
1	Description: Black, thin, dreadlocks.   Austin, TX: 7.8% black population, assume 3.9% male.   We've removed over 96% of potential suspects if every black man in the city is thin and wearing dreads. But that's just not good enough.	As a younger black male from Austin, I’m not sure what to do with myself.	0
1	A farm and household where black victims were enslaved and worked to death.	Oh, that is a terrible place for a wedding, thanks for explaining	0
1	I think the problem stems from what we associate magic with. Black magic isn’t the same as what you see in Harry Potter.	Yeah in fact it's more horrifying and disgusting lol.	0
1	Women prefer black men though. That's not sexist or racist or, if it is, it's the women being racist.  Obviously this applies to straight women only.	um... are you saying that women prefer black men and if they don't they're racist	0

1	There are a lot of videos of a black dude being called the N word, and the dude punching the guy who called him the slur.

1	Democrats only want more government.	OK boomer	0
1	Republicans not having a filibuster to stop them.	If Republicans want something bad enough, they won’t let the filibuster stand in their way.  Case in point - the filibuster for Supreme Court nominees.	0

1	Six are black,  nice business	Entrenched Christianity in back communities. Easy pickings...	0
1	Fuck it. Just write a law where citizens can get paid a bounty for reporting anyone who owns a hand gun. SCOTUS is cool with it, so Democrats would be stupid to not use it.	SCOTUS isn't "cool with it".  They didn't rule on that law at all.	0
1	She also seems like she is pretending to be a person of color.... Like to a disturbing extent....	There's good evidence that there's a fair bit of photoshop going on with the photos supporting that claim. She just goes way too far with the fake tan.	0
1	If you feel attacked because black history is being taught, you have a serious problem with your sense of self.	Right? It's history and should be taught. It's kind of a shame that we even need to call it black history and make a special thing of teaching it. Like I said, it's history and it shouldn't even be a question whether it's taught or not.	0
1	Still wondering why any black American would vote for trump given that trump seems then as tools and not human beings	Money or to feel special in the horrid company that loves to have a single token black friend. See Candace Owens. Then again, they could just be crazy and hateful like Kanye…	0

1	But what if I *know* I'm a badass?	It's not the first time I see news about a badass that beat the shit out of someone just for that someone to come latee with a gun to kill said badass. You never know what someone's willing to do when they're mad enough to fight you	0
1	Texas will stop it. Republicans only believe in local control if they’re the ones doing the controlling.	Austin is still a sanctuary city. Texas attempted to stop that as well. Cities actually have much more autonomy than you’d expect.	0

1	Dems are objectively better about it than Republicans. Please note, that doesn't mean the Dems are *good* by any stretch.	If Biden’s approval rating is any indicator, the dems might be worse at this point.	0
1	The thing about Democrats is that they all like to signal to other Democrats how woke/politically correct they are.  It’s virtue signaling	That’s how you maintain integrity in your party.	0

1	Yup. Back when law abiding citizens could protect themselves from dangerous criminals. Now Democrats have made it so victimizing people is very safe to the criminals.	He was prosecuted for attempted murder, assault, reckless endangerment, but cleared of those charges. He lost a $43 million lawsuit.   We weren't allowed to protect ourselves back then either.	0

1	The point is that this country was founded as a democracy which requires its representatives to be selected based on the will of the public, and Republicans are trying to break that system so they can claim power even after losing elections.	Yes. I understand that.  My point is that this is all theater, and we haven't had actual Democratic control of this country for decades.	0
1	And Trudeau is just walking around banning random guns because if the gun is all black it’s a deadly fully automatic assault nuke launcher and needs to be banned	>because if the gun is all black it’s a deadly fully automatic assault nuke launcher and needs to be banned  This is valid. Trust me, I play video games.	0
1	Blackout curtains...   I work a rotation, daylight to afternoon to midnight weekly.   Blackout curtains are the savior of midnight weeks.	Oh I have those.. Still hard after driving home in the sun lol	0
1	Clayton Bigsby	Can we call him Thomas Bigsby now?	0
1	Democrats could vote to enshrine Roe v. Wade literally any day of the week but they won't.  They didn't under Obama with enormous margins in the Senate, and they certainly won't do so now.    The Democrats are useless.	This canard again. There was literally a bill before the Senate this year on this very issue.	0
1	Worst governor ever	No. Nuisance is	0
1	Is it code for black? Genuinely never heard it before	It means he's a white guy with a little bit of a sun tan	0
1	If you watch the video there is a dude trapped dead to rights and he knows it.  He is screaming his death scream.  The shooter just says "you're Allright "  Dude was white.  All the black people though?  Double tapped.	There’s a video?	0
1	I'm sorry, but where does it say black people are statistically known to commit more crimes? Where is this statistic?   Because whenever I look up crime statistics it's majority white.	>Where is this statistic?   FBI data. They commit an unproportional amount of crimes.	0
1	For Republicans, Joe Biden is an evil mastermind, but also completely senile. It’s quite the accomplishment.	The idea of 'strong but simultaneously weak' or 'evil genius but also ignorant' is a hallmark of fascists. They play both sides and shift focus depending on circumstance and audience.	0
1	Clayton Bigsby	That's really, really funny!!!	0
1	&gt;Start a new fucking party  In the amount of time it would take to form a new party and raise it to the level of national attention, Republicans would ensure that there are no free elections ever again, and then your party would be meaningless.	That's the "moderate" conservatives problem. I'm pretty sure they don't exist anymore though.	0
1	No, I'm asking if Bob was afraid of black people because they are statistically known to commit more crimes, how is that racist?	I'm sorry, but where does it say black people are statistically known to commit more crimes? Where is this statistic?   Because whenever I look up crime statistics it's majority white.	0
1	Yes, that's exactly the question. Read Orlando Patterson.	Why don’t you just tell me, since we’re having a conversation?	0
1	The Black Watch is an infantry battalion that generally wears kilts and traditional Scottish attire, as well as having their own pipe band. Here's a video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvmYHATnFI0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvmYHATnFI0)	Oooh shit thank you	0
1	There’s a black man on the Supreme Court and you all hate his guts. It’s not about their demographic, it’s about whether they agree with you. The demographic is just optics.	Yes, we are judging him by the content of his character. Is that okay with you?	0
1	Because I Was High by Afroman da da dut dut duh	Re re re REMIX! [I like this one better.](https://youtu.be/OY5q9ufbqJo)	0
1	Hmm, all those guns in Texas and not one of them helped. And Republicans say we need more guns.. to what, sit around and do nothing?	Well there was no one with a gun near there. So this isn’t an anti 2A argument. It was a gun free zone.	0
1	Democrats always accuse their opponents of what they are actually doing.	Yup. Democrats are children and every idea they push is based on lies.	0
1	That's the point. Noone has been named, if was a case of she was the most qualified person and happened to be black, that's great but they're  disqualifying anyone but black females. That's not right, sorry to say.	Biden evidently blocked an female African American nominee in the past and might have a guilty conscience and wants to make amends with this nomination.	0
1	Black only its literally ONE family. I guess Black people should all be forced to marry Whites, so that White supremacists don't feel left out of "Black only" commercials depicting a family of two	This would make them melt even faster…	0
1	Well, it's not like there's a labor shortage or supply chain disruptions or anything. It's not like Republicans sabotage the economy every time a Democrat is in the White House, right? Right?	TBH they sabotage the economy when a republican is president also.	0
1	Republicans: You must have BABIES!   Stores: \*run out of formula\*  Parents: \*Look at Republicans\* What now?   Republicans: Dunno, thats YOUR problem now.	I think this should be a pinned, top comment.	0
1	Personally I think Mississippi State won this week.   but... they could have used a tad more cow bell imo.	Yeah. We need a non wine sports network to weigh in and give highlights.	0
1	Except Kentucky is ran by the democrats	The current governor (since 2019) is a Dem, sure.  That doesn’t really mean much, and certainly doesn’t change the fact that KY swings right while relying on the federal government.	0
1	Ask if it's OK to say "black people are criminals"    If she says no or acts super offended, "I didn't say ALL black people."	You'll get banned before you even say "i didn't say all black people"	0
1	Elon Musk could be the Republican nominee for President if he tried. Dead serious.	It's funny to watch conservatives jump on the musk train, when they typically seeth at the idea of tesla	0
1	I'm confused. Aren't they both Republicans?	If you go by voting record	0
1	Black. I like darkness and the night	Mmm interesting. Is it beacuse its peaceful at night?	0
1	When Republicans take back the house and senate and presidency from this incompetent bungling idiot, we will have all of these evil programs reversed	Wishful thinking too bad they will cheat and keep importing illegals who will have 6 anchor babies a piece.	0
1	Yea if you look at the polling they do... most Republicans have more of a spine then you anyway	I get it, you’re a yuge Trump fan  I voted for him twice and will again if he gets the nomination but let’s not act like that doesn’t give us a bigger hassle	0
1	Georgia was a red state too.  Then we kicked out their Republicans.	Let's see how they fair in re-election before claiming it is a done deal, yeah?	0
1	I’m not. As I said, there are decent alternate black Superman characters. But the main one should be as he has been depicted for decades.   Would you be cool with Tom Hardy playing T’Challa Black Panther?	But they have made other changes to the character you do agree with?  I don't care what Tom Hardy does.	0
1	South African blacks say hi.	Massive wealth inequality against them says hi.  The idea that white people in South Africa are suffering institutional racism because they don't get the advantages of literal apartheid is absurd.	0
1	This would be a much easier thing to do if there were 50 other Democratic senators rather than 48.	If you're not counting them there are 46 and two independents	0
1	Mo Brooks is a fucking moron.	Republican Mo Brooks is a Traitor to the United States for helping plan the January 6th Insurrection (along with Republican Andy Biggs, and Republican Paul Gosar), and then participating in it.	0
1	This is exactly what I’m talking about…  Q: Why is he badass?  A:  He’s a force of nature.  Prime Mary Sue material.	He's not a Mary Sue because he's almost not a character.	0
1	I thought Andrew Jackson settled this question in 1832.   Well, Joe Biden is unlikely to get on his horse to hang Gerald Allen, R-Tuscaloosa.  Doesn't have the same historic resonance as John C. Calhoun once did on the tariff question.	Nothing is settled once the people who did the settling are dead.	0
1	They really are not they hang around our black neighbors and everything by rarely I mean very very rare they’re not like for enslaving black people	My fiancee and I ARE black and our kids will still never hear us say it. Very rarely is too many times for a white person.	0
1	Most gendered violence is inflicted on women.   And black people are disproportionately hurt by the justice system.   Those are facts whether you like them or not.	> Most gendered violence is inflicted on women.  By definition.  If a woman kills a man because he's a man it's not gendered violence.	0
1	Not only she wrote a book, but made millions by selling the rights to different movie producers. It was a Netflix producer who discovered the problem while reading her story and saved the man. Black man had to spent 16 years in prison for nothing.	It happens all the time. It amazes me that anyone can be sent to jail or prison on just the words of someone else. Like ask yourself "do people tell lies?" Yes they do. So how in the world do we take lives over the words of another.	0
1	Say what you will about George HW Bush...  At least he fucked off after losing reelection.	The general protocol is for ex-preside to to shut their pie-holes after they lose or are termed out.  Take a wild guess who doesn’t follow the protocol, yep you got it, POtuS Donald “The Grifter” Trumpfoon.	0
1	OP are you seriously championing segregation?  Because I would *love* to introduce you to my racist uncle's version of exactly your post but it's about whites, blacks, and the Irish Pub he likes to frequent.	How the hell did you twist this in your head from “I want a safe space from people who historically have oppressed and brutalized people like me.” To “this guy must be a racist”?	0
1	How is replacing 1 liberal justice with another, vs. 6 conservative justices, supposed to fuck anything up?  All that black woman will get to do is write dissents.  God these people are just so dumb, it's infuriating they have so much voting power	There's a certain word that starts with an N that was implied.	0
1	There's fucking video of it in Fulton County.	you mean the one of something being erased when everything was written in pen?	0
1	All they want is a smoke screen to hide the fact they hate her because she's a black woman.	Say this a lot louder because its true!	0
1	How is this a solution? If the Democrats expand the court when they're in power, won't the Republicans just expand the court once they're in power again? Won't this just cause a big back and forth battle?	Exactly the perfect response	0
1	“Stereotypes” are based off truth. I didn’t say black people, just black girls. Facts can’t be racist	If stereotypes are based in truth then we can safely say that, white people are racist. It's a fact and facts cant be racist 🤷🏽‍♂️	1
1	hi black people in britain were at one point enslaved and they were/are also subjected to racialized laws  hope that clears up why some folks in britain might look at the world through a CRT lens	I get what you’re saying but literally the post above the one you were replying to was arguing that it was specific to the US	0
1	It's definitely **nonvoters** who are to blame for allowing Republicans in office.  It's extremely  * immoral  * unethical  * destructive  * bad for the working class   But it's also a free country, so you should feel free to vote (R)	31 days on Reddit. Hard pass.	0
1	If they vote against the Second Amendment in any way (such as for pro-control laws), they are not true Republicans and should be voted out.	The Republican party should immediately expel any of its members who work with the Democrats on infringing our rights. But that probably won't ever happen.	0
1	The suspects are all black I saw	Where did you see that? I can't find anything about the suspects	0
1	Republicans are maybe more verbally abusive, but Democrats tend to be more violently abusive (lawsuits, cancel culture, etc)	Hmmm. I'm not sure I can agree with that. It's an interesting observation, though.	0
1	No they made jet black and Faye way less slutty. Besides that the acting was terrible.	>No they made jet black and Faye way less slutty.  I don't remember Jet Black being that slutty to begin with. XD	0
1	Jesus. Democrats are fucking pussies. That’s why we lose.	No, the Democrats lose because of the electoral collage, the electoral collage is even a 'close call' because of misinformation.	0
1	This would be a much easier thing to do if there were 50 other Democratic senators rather than 48.	If that were the case, there would be a third "moderate" ready to play scapegoat to get the number back below 50 so there is still an excuse to get nothing done.	0
1	The mayor of NYC issued a vaccine mandate for indoor dining when 2/3 of black New Yorkers aren't vaccinated, but the black guy running for governor of California is David Duke?	I know it’s a episode of the twilight zone! Grew up in Compton and is a klan leader like Duke. How do they even rationalize this trashy sudo journalism.	0
1	Republicans can’t bring themselves to do the right thing. Ever.	That’s a pretty broad statement. Are you implying that if a person has a (D) behind their name instead of an (R) they are morally better?	0
1	Is it just me or it seems every time news come up about election fraud a Republican is caught committing it?	No, it isn't.	0
1	Not only she wrote a book, but made millions by selling the rights to different movie producers. It was a Netflix producer who discovered the problem while reading her story and saved the man. Black man had to spent 16 years in prison for nothing.	Wait what detail did the Netflix producer notice? How did nobody else notice?	0
1	Alabama "the state everyone knows for having a fair and informed view on black culture"/s	You realize Alabama had one of the highest percentages of black population of any state, right?	0
1	They really are not they hang around our black neighbors and everything by rarely I mean very very rare they’re not like for enslaving black people	Even if someone rarely says the N-Word they are still racist. It's like calling someone "mildly racist".	0
1	I will never get over how CRT has become a catch-all word for Republicans' gripes they've had for decades with race politics.	We don't like people pointing out our blatant racism	0
1	Bill Burr, left wing? Lol OK.	He is very much on the left.	0
1	Ask if it's OK to say "black people are criminals"    If she says no or acts super offended, "I didn't say ALL black people."	you know you could say that for every race gender or anything	0
1	Democrats sabotaged Bernie Sanders by... not voting for him. So I'm going to teach them a lesson!	Don't forget they gave Hilary debate questions!! *Checks notes* About water. In Flynt...	0
1	Where Republicans have more rights than humans.	Look, you simply can't go around aborting every incest/rape babies. How else are you going to get more Republicans?	0
1	well since a majority of the undercounted were minorites, who typically vote Democrat, Democrats could do better in new competetive districts than expected.	The obvious problem is that areas may lose representation. Michigan lost a house seat this year. Do you think Detroit was accurately counted?	0
1	Isn't that basically the plot of a black mirror episode?	More Agenda 31, but yeah.	0
1	Blacks can’t be racist   They’re the target of all racism and oppression how can they be racist	Black people can definitely be racist, as can Hispanic people, Asian people, etc.	0
1	Yeah no, false allegations are very real. Ask the black man who spent 15 years in prison on the word of a white woman who then founded her writing career on that.	And only got an "I'm sorry" from her	0
1	If it ain't in the constitution, it's fair game.	There are a lot of thing that aren't in the constitution.	0
1	I’m 6’3 with a 7” dick and only 7 black belts	Average Swede	0
1	I mean personally yea. I’ve never been disappointed with the service I’ve received at a black owned business	I was more thinking about “better”. Always better to me says every time it is better than any other business. That seems statistically unlikely.	0
1	You REALLY want to see the right lose their sh\*t? Michelle Obama does have a Law degree from Harvard. And she is the smart one.	I couldn’t even imagine the backlash from this. They would be calling for literal war.	0
1	And Democrats will just sit back, shrug and wonder why is this happening? Instead of doing something about it.	There isn't any appetite for introspection in the party. All that anyone wants to do is throw up their hands and bemoan the fact that some people "vote against their interests" (oblivious to how incredibly condescending this is).	0
1	They support Black people.  Not all Black people support Black people; see Clarence Thomas for the most powerful example, and Kanye for the dumbest	There are many ways to skin a cat.  But you’re right. Why consider other ideas or ways to better yourself when you can just continue be “oppressed” and a victim.	0
1	It's not. The thing you need to do is show that there were enough black people living in Britain to justify the main hero of British folklore as being a black person.	Except I never made that argument. So you need to actually address my point instead of taking down an argument that I never made	0
1	Just like y'all city's taking over for more then a 100 day as police station burned and you Democrat want to defund the police at least the police was there only because you Democrat haven't taken over Texas yet	For the sake of Texas’s education system I hope they do	0
1	Getting rid of the filibuster could be dangerous. It could give us a few years of rights protected and then empower the GOP to eliminate these rights once they take power	Let's be real, they'll eliminate it themselves either way.	0
1	Slavery: a condition compared to that of a slave in respect of exhausting labor or restricted freedom. Tell me thats not capitalism	That's not capitalism.	0
1	What about black metal? or death industrial?	I'd consider black metal as music. Of course, silly.  The trouble is that it seems like it'd be hard to find. No exposure!   If you want to focus on black music, there'll never be anything better than R&B. Damn good stuff.	0
1	Ok and? Half of all violent crimes in the us are committed by African Americans. That doesn't mean they commit the crimes because they are African American	It's time for you to understand what a confounding variable is.  African Americans. Fatherlessness. Crime.  What do you think is the real explanatory variable? The color of their skin?   Don't be silly.	0
1	The Republican party is in a state of permanent ignorance, at least those that survive.	>The Republican voters are in a state of permanent ignorance  Fixed it for you. Their leaders just realized they can say pretty much whatever they want, and their voters wont care. Hence we have idiotic statements from trump and co	0
1	Apparently….no.  https://www.politico.com/story/2007/01/black-caucus-whites-not-allowed-002389	So the CBC and NAACP really have absolutely to reason to denounce a member of congress in an all white, Asian, Indian, or Hispanic club. So what’s the point of the article?	0
1	the 2-500 piece ones!! i also got this one that was like, all black and it was supposed to be extra challenging.	That's insane. So ones all black, what's the other one like? Oh I'm so curious about people's puzzles haha. Love hearing about what they are drawn to.	0
1	Not only she wrote a book, but made millions by selling the rights to different movie producers. It was a Netflix producer who discovered the problem while reading her story and saved the man. Black man had to spent 16 years in prison for nothing.	Holy fuck. And with the way things usually pan out, she'll either be fined or serve only a few months in prison.	0
1	The motto of the Democratic party is "tradition and civility is more important than the lives of our citizens". Sure it's better than the Republicans "get fucked" but it isn't exactly inspiring.	Does anyone remember when Pelosi single handley defeated racism by wearing Kente Cloth and taking a knee, or have cast of Hamilton perform to commemorate Jan 6.	0

1	How about you replicate Texas' suppressor law?	>How about you replicate Texas' suppressor law?   Please	0
1	Latinos are considered racially Caucasian, due to the diversity of backgrounds. The individual tribes of racial native Americans/native Mexicans/ Aleutians etc, don’t make up much population.    Black Americans are the largest racial minority group.	So all black people are one race, but Latinos aren’t. Got it	1
1	Republican dog	I’ll take that all day over a Democrat network of pedophiles and rapists! There should be absolutely no sympathy for those types of people, regardless of their political affiliation.	0
1	Wtf, I have seen plenty of cases that were not of black men.You're pulling it out of your ass. And I haven't seen one case where it was just misidentification. Please don't come with the "false accusations are rare" bs.I can easily prove that wrong too.	They are exceedingly rare	0
1	I’m not a Democrat. I just fucking hate all Republicans.	I respect that.  I'm not a democrat either.  I'm just fed up with everyone so distracted by the insane fringe of the right wing that they forget that the Democrats have been horrible as well.	0
1	And there's a good reason for that, too many Democrats are beholden to corporate interests and that is a huge turn off for people on the left.	Republicans are steady.  Democrats need inspiration.	0
1	Rape his wife and all of his daughters and he will be singing a different tune. The two necessary character traits needed to be a present-day Republican are a complete lack of empathy and total self-interest driving every aspect of your life.	> Wishing sexual violence on political opponents  Very cool keep it up!	0
1	It's even more hilarious when you remember that it was Republicans who btfo out the Confederacy.	“NOoOooooO yoU IdiOT, thE pARtiEs SWitChED!”	0
1	It has been many years since integrity has been seen within the Republican party.	And the lack of demonstrable action on the part of the democrats shows the same (I’m a democrat and it’s still true)	0
1	I hope ‘BM’ doesn’t stand for black men because if it’s that case she is saying that all black men are low value. That’s insanely racist.	It says ending up a BM, not with a BM. Obviously baby momma not black man.	0
1	It's certainly controversial.  I mean, I just saw an article praising the Batwoman show for "finally" casting a black Joker.	Twitter praise	0
1	Of course he did. Republicans are corrupt lying bottom-feeders.	And democrats aren’t. Right....	0
1	Republicans are radical right wing nuts and so are you if you support them fr	Not all Republicans support this. There are also democrats who are anti-abortion.	0
1	I'm pretty sure the 3/5 was a reference to slavery. Up until the American Civil War slaves were legally considered 3/5 of a person.	No shit	0
1	the difference between cops targeting men and women is far bigger than the white vs black comparison. Police brutality is a sexism issue first and foremost.	Nah, it partially but I’ve seen the videos of the cops and women, they were black women. Sex is involved but I’d say it’s more race	0
1	Marxist in the same tradition of the black panthers egune debs and more.   there is no bottom or top left or right political compus thing is so fucking dumb.	You seriously waited 5 months to post this comment?	0
1	Arnold WAS pretty moderate, but he was an exception - Cali Republicans are just as crazy as Republicans everywhere else.	case in point: devin nunes	0
1	So in other words the media decided not to cancel him for blackface because he would've been replaced by a Republican	In his defense, he couldn't remember if he was in blackface or wearing the Klan robe in the photo. Apparently he had done both so many times he couldn't keep them straight.	0
1	I’ve always said it but it’s my favorite thing to say: Republicans do not care about personal freedoms. Full stop. Period.	Oh, they care about *their* personal freedoms.	0
1	If they had been black, they would have started open firing while retreating	no cops opened fire on groups of black people during blm protests/riots so try again.	0
1	Now that Orange woman has talked about the call can we impeach Biden?	Orange woman bad lol	0
1	Atlanta will look like Baltimore if this happens	Atlanta is already turning into Baltimore.	0
1	That was Assata Shakur of the Black Panther Party, BLM didn’t exist at that point.	Ahh, for whatever reason I thought she was also associated with BLM too.	0
1	Someone told me once that I was a badass and I really appreciated it.	Someone that didn’t know you?	0
1	It seems to me if it is truly a black caucus and you are black you should be allowed to join.	That would make it a club, not a caucus. They both might have some parallels, but the former is more recreational, while the later is more geared towards political goals.  Do you understand?	0
1	Did you even watch the video of the George Floyd murder?  The video clearly shows the scumbag cop straight up murdering him, and he got convicted of 3rd degree **murder.**	Not true. There is no way of knowing if it was intentional or not.	0
1	Rioting after a cop slowly killed a black man in front of witnesses and trying to overthrow the federal government because the country didn't vote the way you wanted them to, are very different things. Trying to compare them is ingenious.	Oh you like apples? But what about ORANGES?	0
1	Cool, so the Democratic Party is compromised.	at this point the one way the party can distance themselves from him is firing up the very obvious bribery investigation, making sure to get his daughter implicated for all the EpiPen corruption too, and getting them both thrown in rich people jail	0
1	100%. The sentencing disparity between men and women absolutely dwarfs the sentencing disparity between black and white convicts.	If you're a black woman you're basically a man for the law, and if you're a black male you're the fucking Xenomorph.	0
1	The script has flipped and for the first time ever Republicans are the cool rebellious kids sticking it to the man.	When does the media call these people heroes like they did with the Texas Dems during their superspreader tour?	0
1	For Republicans, Joe Biden is an evil mastermind, but also completely senile. It’s quite the accomplishment.	Old nazi technique.  The enemy is both incredibly strong and simultaneously incredibly weak	0
1	Black Lives Matter is really just short hand for "Black Lives Matter Too". All Lives don't matter until Black Lives also Matter.   Its not...whatever you just said.	So then what's the point of protesting when that's already the status quo? When was the last time people were out on the streets for any other cause thats already the way things are?	0
1	The suspects are all black I saw	It’s funny that all the articles I read so far haven’t mentioned his race, only found out from Twitter and the police scanner where they mentioned the suspect description.	0
1	What does being cis have to do with her being black?	Uh, no one said that.	0
1	Yet somehow Democrats will sing her praises for it.	Look at her skin color! Wow!  I don't care if she's the most useless woman on planet earth,  because all I see is skin color and....   *Wait a minute*	0
1	There is one black guy and a few white guys later. What is racist there?	Are you being obtuse, or are you genuinely not aware of what this signifies?	0
1	Democrats only want more government.	Republicans want to give the authority of government to private sectors with no oversight to voters.	0
1	99% of Supreme Court justices have been picked because they were white men.  Why is a black woman less okay to pick?	That’s false	0
1	Republicans and democrats will work together to kill even the idea of a viable third political party.	Go ahead waste your vote!	0
1	A Black life that truly matters!	Uhhhhh..	0
1	Democrats are left holding the bag and paying for Republican-made problems, once again.	And they’ll be blamed for trying to fix it. As evident by the comment section. Damned if he does and damned if he doesn’t try to fix it	0
1	Yes. The police have apprehended a black man and charged him with her crime. Open and shut case.	Sprinkle some crack on him, Johnson.	0
1	If you feel attacked because black history is being taught, you have a serious problem with your sense of self.	Agreed.  Why are you identifying with the villains of the story?  What about them is cutting so close to home?	0
1	That's jury tampering, Jack! That's a felony	I would not hold my breath waiting for this DA or the DOJ to pursue the matter	0
1	If the idea is that checks would repair negative affects to black people from racism, then after the checks are delivered wouldn't it no longer be accurate to say any lasting negative affects are from racism? Isn't the problem solved by the checks?	That's not the idea though. It never was the idea. Checks don't solve racism.	0
1	So uh… what does this have to do with being conservative exactly? Are we just making fun of successful black people now and not even hiding the racism?	Why is it that everything is "racism?" Lebron is a clown regardless of his race.	0
1	I ask them do black men have to change too and watch them play mental gymnastics to avoid being seen as racist.	That is rather amusing but I'm not a fan of that burning smell it causes.	0
1	Where's the lie?     Jussie Smollet and BLM rioters proved that black privilege is real.	Jussie was convicted of filing a false police report amongst other charges….	0
1	*eustass and yeah i think the name's badass too	For surree	0
1	All they want is a smoke screen to hide the fact they hate her because she's a black woman.	Like the psychotic, hateful smears against Kavanaugh and also Barrett because she is a white Christian woman?   But but but but	0
1	So you have no objections to someone who is fearful of all black men and shames them as a group, since that demographic commits a disproportionate amount of crimes?	no im saying women are allowed to stop creepy men from getting in there lives	0
1	If I asked you “do you think black people are worthy of rights?”, you wouldn’t immediately assume that I thought they weren’t?   Because that’s the only reason you ask that question	Hey I want to thank you for continuing the conversation because I really do value your participation in the talk and a lot of people just run from a talk.	0
1	Democrats could vote to enshrine Roe v. Wade literally any day of the week but they won't.  They didn't under Obama with enormous margins in the Senate, and they certainly won't do so now.    The Democrats are useless.	Nobody should’ve ever expected a pack of mass-murdering war-criminals to do the right thing.	0
1	&gt;the pro-slavery side of the Civil War is winning.  No, actually, it was the Democrat party that ruled over the Jim Crow south.	Party platforms switched, ya silly billy.	0
1	That's a nope	fair enough	0
1	Every politician is power hungry and this current administration lived off pitting people against each other based on race. Did you forget "if you don't vote for me, you ain't black?"	If you have trouble finding whether you're for me or Trump, then you ain't black  On video, for anyone wondering	0
1	When do people start going to jail? I want justice from the Justice Department.	This isn’t illegal.	0
1	I mean, it doesn't matter because the voters are ultimately going to choose whichever one promises to hurt Democrats the most.	The hardcore liberal haters will certainly vote for anyone who isn't a Democrat.	0
1	Democrats should just start wearing cowboy hats and flannels.	Absolutely. Also, stop reimbursing stupidlandia using blue state revenue.	0
1	Are you saying all black people don't value black lives?	If you take a look at the per capita crime statistics by race, one could infer that.	0
1	How is replacing 1 liberal justice with another, vs. 6 conservative justices, supposed to fuck anything up?  All that black woman will get to do is write dissents.  God these people are just so dumb, it's infuriating they have so much voting power	If you think they are dumb, look and your side's base sometime.	0
1	Like I said, slavery is a choice.	Actually back then there was far more pressure to get married, especially you wanted to be a part of professional or respectable society.	0
1	I've voted Democrat my entire life.  I won't be this year.  The Democrats have gone way too far left and radical.  If they don't get the far left faction of the party under control soon, they're going to be wiped out in the midterms.	You're supposed to play jazz songs to keep us listening.	0
1	Why does it matter that she’s black?	Ask the cops.	0
1	You're blaming the fact that people are voting for Republicans on their opposition? Education of voters is the problem, not that we don't have alternative choices.	We need more than two bought and sold partys.	0
1	Democrats coined that term first to refer to Fox News.	Fair enough! Thank you for the correction. I feel bad giving credit to Trump for creating something he actually stole.	0
1	Clayton Bigsby	Don’t smear my name like this.	0
1	I’ll agree to a point, but all racist assholes are Republicans.	great point as well	0
1	The left only cares about stuff like this when a Republican is involved.	Liberal here.  Lock them all up.	0
1	You know, I REALLY need to get around to watching Black Mirror sometime. It's referenced a whole lot, and many of the things I talk about or create, someone mentions it at least once.	One thing I'd recommend is don't be scared to skip episodes. Black mirror is a serial not a series so aside from a few Easter eggs you can watch the episodes in any order you want. If an episode doesn't look interesting to you try another one.	0

1	Democrats spent 4 years saying the 2016 election was rigged.  When Republicans suggest the 2020 election was rigged, Democrats say "That's impossible. Elections can never be rigged. To even suggest such a thing is insurrection."	Pretty accurate they even started limiting or deleting some of their old videos showing how bad dominions systems are	0
1	Let’s go back to the beginning when blacks got freedom and to vote and get jobs. You tell me the history of blacks in America . Be specific and we’ll go from there.which party did what and when?	The Republicans were the liberal party back in Lincoln's day. Racism is a conservative characteristic.	0
1	Had a black guy in my squad in the army with a confederate flag tat. When asked why he always answered "Because I'm from Georgia" as if the question was silly. Still left me a bit confused but to each their own.	Was it a Confederate flag or was it a Georgia state flag? Until a few years ago the GA flag was basically a Confederate flag that had a block of blue with the state seal in it on the left side.	0
1	BLM. Listening to the sensationalism you would think over 1000 black people were being shot and killed by cops every year. Turns out the real number is closer to 20.  This plus all the grifting really damages the validity of their claims	How many white people are being shot and killed by cops because of the color of their skin?	1
1	When cops are told/trained to assume anyone with a gun is a bad guy   Bet they don't do that shit in TX ...	> When cops are told/trained to assume anyone with a gun is a bad guy   If a cop can kill you just cuz you have a gun then the 2nd amendment is less than useless	0
1	The FBI and CIA are such corrupt organizations that only hurt the American people. Have you ever looked at the CIAs connection to the crack epidemic, that still is affecting the black community today?	That’s the tip of the ice Berg. Allen Dulles funded hitlers war efforts along with a bunch of “American Royalty” look up the history of globalism. Pretty crazy stuff.	0
1	The Wisconsin GOP is not tearing itself apart. It's just gone batshit crazy, and refuses to listen to anyone who is sane.	And they will all get re-elected again by landslides because this is why we can’t have nice things. Like legal pot.	0
1	The black people aren't putting on white face. They're just playing the part in their own skin.	How does black skin playing pale skin work?	0
1	I wish she would shut up and go away before Democrats lose because of her	Republicans love her and the rest of the squad. Can't wait til one of those idiots runs for president.	0
1	Are you American? That person would be called mixed or biracial or half-black. In my case, it’s not evenly half and half, so I’m partially black. This is the common term.	What part of the world phrases things so uniquely?	0
1	So basically, Republicans will screech no matter what.  Got it.	Yes.  The democrats don't seem to get this and wamt to appease them and respond to the nonsensical talking points.	0
1	Quite interesting to me how Democrats already know they're going to lose the House, possibly the Senate as well.	>Democrats have done pretty much nothing since Biden won the presidency.  Which is to say, way more than Republicans since Trump won the presidency.	0
1	Supreme Court gonna knock it down.	Straight to court, right away.	0
1	Do you think they arrested four people based on this article? Like the article was written about four arrests of people that voted twice and then the cops went out and just arrested four random Republicans to make it true?	They didn’t arrest anyone.	0
1	And Trudeau is just walking around banning random guns because if the gun is all black it’s a deadly fully automatic assault nuke launcher and needs to be banned	Yah I feel like we could do better than ban some guns. I would be a lot happier if we simply taxed them at a high rate, and used the profits to help deal with the actual issues that are causing violence such as homelessness and drugs.	0
1	“I think the tragedy is that we have a Congress with a Senate that has a minority of misguided senators who will use the filibuster to keep the majority of people from even voting.”  -Martin Luther King Jr.	People are fed and entertained.  Won't changed in my lifetime.	0
1	Slavery can be bad but a lot of slave owners were treating their slaves well	Treating their slaves well??? LMAO let me go laugh for 10 min. Whew the ignorance	1
1	[It came out that she constantly bashes black men and these tears are for the white guys who didn't choose her](https://twitter.com/Tosci_Marie/status/1490436031950299138?t=xkUPdTYc756WsVSQgmeBqg&amp;s=19)	Everyone is supporting her in the tweet wtf	0
1	Sure.  Men are subhuman and don't feel pain like "real" people do.  Same as what they used to say about black people to justify slavery.	my favourite response is "by other men" it's like the holy gospel of gotcha comments.  except when it comes to women.	0
1	Democrats keep inching towards communism.	They've been in a full sprint for a while now.	0
1	The article wafts Democrat bias.	That's what I noticed too.. "former president Trump's false claims of a fraudulent election" was the first clue	0
1	It's so pathetic.  Opposition to slavery was literally the reason the Republican party was founded.	They don't give a single fuck about history. They care about making themselves look like the good guys. That's all they care about, good guys being Democrats defeating the bad guy Republicans. Its what they see in movies, life is more complex	0
1	I've voted Democrat my entire life.  I won't be this year.  The Democrats have gone way too far left and radical.  If they don't get the far left faction of the party under control soon, they're going to be wiped out in the midterms.	hahaha  I hope you realize there isn't a single person here who believes you	0
1	So in simple terms, you want more Democrats voting?	That would be a nice side effect (if it was actually true) but the main reasons are the ones addressed in my post.	0
1	And Democrats will just sit back, shrug and wonder why is this happening? Instead of doing something about it.	Are our policies unattractive to minorities?  No, its those dumb savages who are too stupid to understand that I, coastal elite WASP extraordinaire, knows what BIPOC in disadvantaged areas need	0
1	No. Slaves on plantations did not make millions a year. NFL players are independent contracted workers.	They can also quit at any time. It's not like people are going to chase them down, capture them, and beat them into submission.	0
1	What are you basing the claim that Shontel Brown is a centrist on?	Maybe they're talking about some of the stuff mentioned here: https://www.theclevelandobserver.com/shontel-browns-actual-record/	0
1	I'm confused. Aren't they both Republicans?	Manchin is a democrat but prioritizes personal wealth. I’m a vegetarian who eats meat 2-3 times a day.	0
1	So therefore having “Woman Owned Business” or “Black Owned Business” is also virtue signaling? Correct?  Maybe, maybe not.  More likely, it’s a marketing ploy to get people to spend their money in one place as opposed to another.	Correct.	0
1	Florida will appeal and the Supreme Court will overturn this ruling.  It's what they do nowadays.	I am 100% in agreement, and would fall out of my chair if they actually did the right thing.	0
1	Bet you’ll be crying for it when you’re 65. And learned to read from state sanctioned education.  Is that slavery? No. It’s for the common good.	>Bet you’ll be crying for it when you’re 65. And learned to read from state sanctioned education. Is that slavery? No. It’s for the common good.  I see, your a socialist.	0
1	If he frames it as Honor Killing, he would get a free pass, right?   I think Sharia supports honour killing and there's no punishment for that, if I'm right.	Nope, no where is it stated. It's a cultural thing. Honour killings happens a lot in India as well. Either way, this fucker will hang.	1
1	The rug does not have energy or power as far as I know. The "energy" comes from prayer and praise of Allah who is the light of Heaven and Earth.	I understand! I have never felt such power of God before in my life! It is good to be in his presence!	0
1	Ameen, yeah, that's the best thing to do, if you'd like, I can try to help you, I'm studying to become a scholar of the religion alhamdulillah. If you'd like that, feel free to pm me اِنْ شَاءَ اللّٰه	Ma Sha Allah. Thanks, I will think about it.	0
1	Um so a Bengali lady just beated a man just because he said mind your own business	Why did he not hit her back? Or hit her after she was aggressively grabbing and pulling on his clothing? I wouldn't take that kind of disrespect without throwing hands at the individual	0
1	I think thats the Turkish spelling. I mean, they spell Khadijah as "Hadije" and Muhammad as "Mehmet".	There are Muhammets too but Mehmet is same but more common	0

1	Allah swt forbids the consumption of pork. Is looking at the drawn little pigs now also part of eating them? Western values ​​would mean netflix is ​​also haram. Youtube mostly too. Also reddit, instagram, facebook....	Netflix is Haram no doubt. The other stuff probably depends on what you consume. But there is nothing Halal on Netflix so...	0
1	She's not a Muslim if she needs the threat of force to wear a hijab.	In the eyes of the father, the husband and the community, she is Muslim if she wears the hijab. It’s a matter of perspective.	0

1	Seeing from your comments you seem to have a superficial understanding thats why again id invite you to actualy see and study what islam and other religions belief.	I'm keeping my comments in this thread deliberately general, I have a decent understanding of Islam. I was brought up as a Muslim and have studied the Quran since I was a kid. Though I can only understand the translation, don't know Arabic.	0
1	I'm actually a cleric! I lead my own flock! I'd love a moment of your time to discuss your interest in the Prophet Mohammad.	Can you believe it? They'll let anyone lead a religion these days!	0

1	Oh well then say that??? So sick of you people referring to Allah as “sky daddy”. It’s islamaphobic and actually disgusting to be so disrespectful	“You people”, could you clarify as to what that means? ‘Cause that sounds low key racist	0
1	Ahaha nothing calms the local white folks down like Muslims pointing weapons out of windows.	Youre mozlem hawk eye	0
1	How do you expect to have your nose touch the ground during sujud when it's a requirement for a valid sujud?	Speaking of requirements, you just told a brother to stay home if he's worried, despite the obligation of jumu'ah prayer.	0
1	Well coolnathaniel42 already proved you wrong for me	No he didn’t. See my responses.	0

1	Ye. It was Allah’s will for them to destroy the Muslims. A big test for us	Still makes me bid sadge, though :,(	0
1	No it doesn’t but why don’t you find a group of muslim in your country to plan it together or a muslim agency that can plan you Hajj? I think with a group of people you gonna feel safer and can really enjoy doing this faridah.	How would I find one in my country?	0

1	Evil eye is caused by people, not anybody else. It can be prevented. Just like only Allah's will will keep you safe on the road but a seatbelt will actually improve your chances of survival	Yeah but evil eyes aren’t the solution, it’s pretending to do something only Allah can do which makes it shirk.	0

1	I don’t think that anyone was talking about purpose, but in Islam, the belief is that children are free of sin, and if they die, they ascend straight to heaven, where they experience a much better life than they could have ever had here.	Why do people say it was Allah's plan or will for someone to die? When is it His plan and when is it not?	0

(IIRC, it’s also a female owned business.)	Thanks for the recommendation. I just sent my sister the link so she can buy her daughter cool dresses with pockets. My neice refuses to wear pants most of the time. She even played soccer last season in her pink skirt.	0
1	Didn't know Killing middle eastern civilians as a American terrorist in a game is halal.	You never kill middle eastern civvies in those games	0
1	Priests and pedophilia go together like bread and butter. I agree with you there.	If you mean that sometimes bread can have butter on it.  But plenty of bread doesn't have butter on it.  And that  butter can go on tons of things that aren't bread, I agree 100%  So, an atheist scientist who acts like this pastor?  Fuck 'em?	1
1	Lmao what am I supposed to do instead of popping my knuckles/my whole body? Live with that stiff feeling forever? It pops at some point without me intending it anyway. And I've never heard about any side effects either, dafuq is he talking about	He should hear me pop my neck 😂😂 therapeutic haha	0
1	Still laughing that there were people earnestly arguing that Tulsi was to the left of BERNIE SANDERS.	I'm not trying to say she was, but she has definitely drifted much further right since the election	0
1	Do you even know that a non-Muslim has to convert to Islam after marriage? I think first you should acquire some basic knowledge regarding things which you don't know.	I know and people who are getting married are not kids. They are adults and making their choice. Why are you against their choice ?	1
1	The prophet could not write. By your own logic, you should reject the Quran.	The Quran is completely different than Hadith’s.	1
1	That’s not what I meant. I meant that what’s leading her to suicide is the fact that she got into a Haram relationship	Oh yeah true sorry. I thought you were preferring suicide over haram relationship.	0

Nowadays people just throw the name wahabi to whomever shows them that their bidaati ways are not part of the Quran and sunnah.	0
1	JazakAllah	No worries man although you could of kept the post on this sub as well	0
1	I mean if the Quran hasn’t been changed and there is evidence that the Quran wasn’t changed, then why shouldn’t Muslims believe?	So what if the Quran hasn't been changed? Being unchanged doesn't turn a work of fiction into a work of fact.  But as another commenter has mentioned, "circumcision" isn't in the Quran anyway.	0
1	Yes, according to Hadith.  Music/songs is evil, I saw a dying person repeats the verses of a song instead of Shahada.	New Muslim, what is the reason for music being haram? I think I remember hearing a long time ago that it is because it distracts from Allah and praying, but by that logic, couldn't anything be that? Video games, football, dancing?	0
1	I was hoping someone would say that haha	I'm not even joking.   Compare regular MC graphics.  Then turn something like Sildur's Vibrant Shaders on.  Absolutely breathtaking honestly.	0

1	in the 70s or 80s, they started changing slowly. they started praying like ahlus sunnah and alot of the heretical beliefs went away. **but** then they came back lmaooo.	The social reform they have done for the lives of its members is still admirable. You had people who were homeless junkies becoming productive workers and people, but it’s such a shame. Inshallah they find the true Islam like Malcolm X did.	0
1	Don’t worry we the govnt always give back freedoms. It’s just temporary. We promise.	Stop being such a silly conspiracy theorist, jeez you guys. Also, we're gonna need that digital ID on your phone to sign into your social media accounts. Just to be extra super duper safe, ok?	0

1	No. Their culture is unusually perverted. Muslims are already [extremely clean](https://i.redd.it/8jhdatagpy681.jpg) anyway.	It’s true, but it doesn’t mean they don’t possess the qualities I listed earlier. I didn’t say Muslims aren’t clean, but Japanese people are renowned to be extremely clean. By clean I don’t only mean body, but also surroundings, house, etc…	0

1	It started with a group of slave owning terrorists known as the founding fathers seceding from the Empire on flimsy premise to ensure they maximized their own profits and kept their subjects dumb.	Wow! How could you be so confident, and yet so severely wrong? This is straight up anti-historical.	1
1	Also just wanna say I’ve noticed this has been a pretty nice conversation for a topic like this on Reddit 😂 so thanks for that haha	I have to say you don’t feel like you’re being disrespectful. I’m getting the vibe you respect gender, even if you disagree with it.   Which at the end of the day is all that matters.   Live and let live.	0
1	End the relationship and repent, if he’s a decent Muslim then he’ll understand the mistake and move on, just like you’re trying to do. If he doesn’t then you’ll know what type of person he is.	Yeah, he's not Muslim btw	0
1	Funny because a lot of men say there is a patriarchy and that it should stay in place. Hahaha.	Yes men are never wrong about anything.	0

1	no, its not because that presumes that the taliban isnt a terrorist organization.  The government may not defined them as such but that doesn't stop me from defining them as such or considering my government to be liars.	And your feelings don't matter when a professor is asking you to explain why reality is reality.	0

1	non-muslim here. What does this mean?	I believe it is in reference to the claim that Jesus (a.s) is the son of God.	0
1	In modern usage, hijab refers to headcoverings worn by Muslim women.  It would be more accurate to call it a veil, which I 100% support for women if they want	So what's your problem with it then? Calling it a hijab rather than a veil? It's just semantics lol	0
1	Its not about you, their sins are between them and Allah so you shouldn’t judge their sincerity.	Does the same apply to women who commit zina?	0
1	This post for me is so interesting because 90% of all the Muslims in my life drink alcohol, but I fear how they'd react if I brought it up.  Last week Friday I even had some guy telling me about the greatness of Allah while holding a Budweiser.	Interesting. I guess you are around those who are bad influence. MAJORITY of muslims don’t drink. In fact alcohol is illegal and almost impossible to find in some muslim nations	0
1	Why is everyone converting to Islam now?	Really, it's wonderful to see people believing either way. I always adore seeing people find faith and love. We all need something to stand on and this is beautiful in its own right.	0
1	Assalamu Alaikum if I use [islamqa.org](https://islamqa.org) for fatwa is that fine?	Wa Alaikum Salam, I would suggest asking local scholars but islamqa.org is fine but it's important to choose a website in islamqa.org that can relate to the struggles of someone in the west. Thats why I also say local scholars	0

1	is there a link to it? Like reverts or something. Most people just say that Muslims tend to have more children compared to other groups.	More children+ a lot of people are converting, especially since it’s so easy to spread dawah these days with tiktok, Instagram…	0
1	I didn't say you did anything intentionally. Just becareful before sharing such things. Check the Hadith and it's authenticity.	Okay, well its a nice reminder of hadith, we have a lot of islamophobia irl rn, I could tell them this hadith, thanks for the hadith	0
1	I'd say all the scenarios you posted are equally likely since they are all conjectures. How is it more likely that Allah exists compared to the universe being a computer simulation? Both cases are unfalsifiable and can't be proved by any evidence?	Because for the claim of Allah (swt) existing we have a book that is claimed to be sent down by him. thats what needs to be falsified wouldnt you agree?	0
1	They're making their way over to the 'tomb' where Rasoolullah PBUH and the first two Khalifahs are buried, may Allah be pleased with them.	Isn’t that inside the masjid though?  It looks like they’re just walking past it from outside.	0

1	You mean the ones that get taken away easily when you're labeled as a terrorist, without needing to provide direct proof? Those "rights"?	You just (intentionally, I suspect) explained why red flag laws are a bad idea and probably unconstitutional.  It also seems you did this without most of reddit realizing, given the upvotes.  Well done.	0
1	I also wondered if these sins will be forgiven with tawbah because they say ALL sins would be forgiven with tawbah.	Insha'Allah they will be. [I provided an explanation for OP which I hope you might find beneficial](https://www.reddit.com/r/islam/comments/utukyi/sins_ummah/i9c0vfb/).	0

1	Have you considered your just meeting bad people who happen to be Christians? Seems unfair to base all of them off a couple you’ve met who probably all have the same culture of being a prick	I can find no correlation between religion and good/bad people.  Good people want to do good, bad people want to do bad, and a full range in between, whether they’re believers or otherwise.  Respect people for what they do, not for religion or not.	0
1	Thats awesome! Do you enjoy giving advice? Have you thought about starting a class doing that? Great easy and fun way to make money. Just by your user name and profile, I can totally see you doing that.

Im a Muslim and 100% believe in Allah swt Im just looking for an answer to this question.	If you can explain how a multi-god system works without conflicts between gods than you can explain it to me. And if there is conflict between these gods, how is the universe not destroyed yet?	0

1	I’m so sorry. I really understand that pain. If you ever feel ready, know that the Church is becoming more affirming everyday, and not all Christians are like this.	I appreciate it and I'm glad to hear there's less and less gay kids being treated terribly. I likely never will, there's far more issues I take with the church than that. But I am glad to hear things are changing.	0

That being said, I’m not convinced that anyone alive knows how to do this	There's many people here in South East Asia that can do black magic lmao.

1	It is a stretch to say an change in the number of Google searches for atheism or Islam has a correlation with conversion rates.

1	Wait, I don't understand... if you are not to distinguish between prophets, then why is the prophet Muhammad praised so much in Islam? There are hadiths of him, some celebrate his birthday, read stories about him, sing nasheeds that extol his virtues, etc.	The Prophet is a special case. He was the last, the Seal, God's final messenger to whom the Quran was given to. We don't distinguish between other prophets but Muhammad (saw) is the Messenger.	0

Because, that's becoming more mainstream in the west.	0

Regardless, both are considered aconsidered	That doesn’t change anything. They’re nafil prayers. That translates to voluntary prayers. Also, he did miss them while he was traveling except for the Fajr. He also didn’t command anyone to pray them, so they are by default voluntary	0

1	The hadith itself mentions that they were malaa'ikah. You are misinforming the readers with your assumptions.	again, the angels part is not omitted in my comment.  and the thing was Ufo, later *identified* by Prophet as Angels. so what is it about my assumptions?	0

1	Salam Brother, why make a comparison like that? Needless comparison. Doesn’t make a point and just needlessly comparing the two holy cities to make one look better than the other. Both are holy.	I think it's because the prophet's mosque is less crowded and doesn't have construction zones scattered around. But getting a quiet place in the latest expansion of the haram is unbeatable	0
1	Lol it's proven haram by rhe hadith that says do not copy thr mushrikeen	But that's such a broad statement. Any specific hadiths that prohibit the celebration of birthdays/non-religious celebrations?	1

1	Just because terrorists claim to be sunnis doesn't mean  they are. We can simply look at the Quran and hadith and see that some of them are not Muslims at all.	The same goes for People who claim to be shia and worship Ali😂	0
1	Depends on your mahdhab	Yeah the hanafis differentiate between men and women. All other madhabs say it is the same way for a man and woman	0
1	Common misconception among Muslims for choosing name, anything arabic must be good name, be it means City, Stone, Tree and the list goes on.	Eh not really my thinking. I love the city of Madina Al Munawarrah and I like the fact that the "nickname" would still be a Muslim name in Dina. Might just go with that.	0

1	Kim Jong Un and Putin are not an equivalent, it's one thing not to take shit, another to threaten another powers leader , which is equivalent to threatening that leaders death, e.g. Sadam, Gadadfi etc	I think they're pretty equivalent tbh. Both despots who think they're the biggest guy in the room.	0
1	These degenerates will never overshadow how one of their highest officials became Muslim after attempting to remove their country of Islam	He's Dutch, and as far as I know in the Netherlands.

1	That’s the thing, this is not haram. Alcohol isn’t haram. It’s how you use it that makes an ‘act’ haram.	But it wouldn't be justified to decorate your hous with bottles of wine when you could just use bottles of grapejuice.	0

1	Instead of fighting for &amp; against this topic wouldn’t it be amazing if there were trusted &amp; known Islamic institutes in the west that could assist in mortgages whilst being interest free.	But it's not there yet. So the solution here is Muslims should not go into any sort of professional program? Let's make Muslims the laborers of the world, then?	0

1	Is no one gonna talk about the “Random Question”? (What is uttered quietly after Surah al Fatiha) i know its Ameen,but I’m just surprised everyone else is talking about the last question instead lol	The whole point of the post was for people to talk about the Surah question.

1	How about Muslims coming to their senses? According to Christianity Muslims will go to hell. Never saw a Christian beeing ashamed to say that. But our fellow Muslims always try to please everyone. You can pray for her family instead, how about that?	Where did I state we should pray for her? I said, is it a good idea advertising it far and wide that she will burn in hell. Why state the obvious and hurt someone whose already hurting.  After all humanity is something isn’t it?	0
1	You pray right when you come in. Fard Salah takes priority over Sunnah.	Do you pray isha alone or in congregation since the imam is praying taraweeh in 2 rakaat?	0

1	Muslimah here. Saying stuff like this is why we’re considered barbaric. Shame on you 🥰	You're right. This is insane. 🥰	0
1	Many non Muslims point to comments such as this to claim we’re barbaric. If nothing else, he should watch what he says.	Are you in this deen to appease idiot westerners who's societies are ripping themselves apart, or are you in it to be a muslim?	0

1	Sure. Christianity is increasing at a higher rate than Islam, and it’s not illegal in those countries not to be Christian. I think that’s telling.	How many countries even have Christianity as the national religion other than Vatican City?	0
1	If we go by his logic satan was very brave when he refused God's order	I have the feeling it's certain cultural perception and corrupt government policy in some Islamic majority countries that drives people away.	0
1	https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Savita_Halappanavar	Thank you.  Sadly, both cases are real.

1	I wish i could do something. I have thought of starting a rebellion aganist China but i don't it's going to work and it's not realistic. I don't know, the only thing we can do is raise awareness and make du'a to Allah	It *would* be realistic if we had an imam to lead us  Even if Allah doesn't give us victory in this world we will die martyrs and we will motivate others to join us	0
1	Sheikh Mo and Haya are both Muslim	And your point being?	0
1	Not allowed. If Allah commands us to be dutiful to our parents even if they commit shirk which is the biggest sin in Islam then we should be dutiful to them for the sins below that such as murder, rape, mutilation, etc.	So if your Dad tried to rape you as a child, you would still be happy seeing him?	0
1	Not the ones we have today, they have changed their religion and it is no longer the same as in the time of Prophet Isa (AS).	Would you say may be a mormon can get in to the paradise? Or some more authoritarian variation of christianism?	0

1	Are you saying Christians are transphobic?	LOL.  You seriously can't be this out-of-touch with Christianity.	0
1	Atheism is the real faith. Really to be an atheist you have to believe in all improbable premises.	Most atheists are just agnostic-atheists meaning they choose to not believe in any God due to lack of evidence. I would be open to believing in God if the evidence were to present itself.	1
1	Tbh it's at least 2 democrats, no way Sinema would've let this pass either. But he's right about the overall message he's sending.	This is why a large chunk of midterm messaging needs to be making them irrelevant.	0

1	Mark my words, Sinema will be just like Trump and NOT be re-elected. She'll be viewed as a one-term failure by almost everyone, just like Trump.	But will she even care when she loses lol, she’s already got her end of the deal and making sweet bank and leaving a millionaire	0
1	Crazy isnt it? I mean If prayers were like in Mecca everywhere I would join 5 am club. Otherwise doesnt seem realistic to me.	In Makkah, it depends on the season. At one point of the year, Fajr is around 4am. Still gotta pray Fajr regardless of where you reside.	0
1	A Maqam is a tone at which the Qur’an is recited. The plural of Maqam is Maqamat.	Bro I’m this context it means standing place, so you would have different jamaat for salah for different madhabs if I’m understanding correctly	0

1	Christians make excuses on why their god allows suffering. My response is if I had the power to prevent suffering, I would.	God cannot be all powerful, all knowing, and benevolent. An all powerful, All knowing God that allows a school shootings and childhood cancers to happen isn't worthy of praise.	0
1	The remake of Mulan, the main actress supports the CCP so I dont watch. I still stand with Hong Kong and Taiwan.	My wife demanded we watch it, so I found someone had uploaded it to pornhub. Watched it, hated it. Not just the actress, the whole movie was bad.	0

1	I think Tabjeegh is when a group of people go to a Muslim's house and invite them to attend a sermon/lecture in the local Mosque. Or basically making sure the local Muslims are attending the mosques and giving them knowledge.	oh I don’t know if I can do that lol i’m only a child rn	0

1	So many random thoughts pop up during Salah. We should all strive to fight it. And all of the things around us are signs for us to realise. It's complicated for us but for Allah it's just be and it becomes.	Exactly. I have a lot of thoughts I try to suppress during Salah but this one really helped me put more focus into salah. It elevates Salah from ritual to purposeful (in the words of my Mulanah) and it's extraordinary.	0

1	Wasting time, magic involved, nude involved, bad language involved, music involved, there is even shirk in it, watching shirk without believing in it is at least major sin(this was said by daiya and some scholars if i’m not mistaken).	it's not shirk, it's fake.  u can mute and read subtitles	0
1	Its still a reasonable assumption to make though. Unless you are in Israel its almsot guranteed to be a Muslim just because of how few Haredi Jewish women there are that wear Burqas.	Good point. Thanks for saying.	0

1	Having a pet dog that has no purpose is haram.	Nope you are putting culture over Islam. As long as a dog is kept outside, there is no reason you cant keep it. The Quran lets you eat meat a dog has retrieved using its mouth. If they were truly haram then the Quran would not have even allowed this.	0

1	I think you might mean Islam isn't pacifist, that would be true. But Islam is the religion of peace, because it promotes peace, through, mercy, justice, and truth. Islam does allow violence and war, within a limited scope and context.	The problem when you say "is a religion of peace" is that you put "peace" as the highest of its values, where truth and justice come first. Peace is a byproduct of justice and truth.	0

1	What is a dua? Not a Muslim here, just interested about learning Islam. I hope the perpetrator is punished.	There are different 'forms' of prayer. Dua is one of the forms and it is basically invoking Allah and making a request, if you like.

Neither choice takes anything from you.	0

1	I feel like most reasonable people have the same line as NATO.  If Russia invade a NATO country, NATO should collectively defend that country by all necessary and logical means, including but not limited to no fly zones.	Sure, but my question has a point to it all the same	0
1	It is. Through the lots of people who responded , I have changed my mind.	Oh, that's really cool. I changed my mind in a similar way.	0
1	Imagine if she kidnapped the kid. Really sad.	Well there's a new fear unlocked. I used to just worry about my shoes...	0

1	How else are we supposed to make the Californians leave?	I don't care how many cases of raped and battered  children have to move to the back of the already-overstretched investigatory line, I've got *Californians* on my lawn!  Nice take.	0
1	The French Revolution also had a functional opposition, and 60% of the French weren't pretending that they were temporarily displaced royals.	let them eat cake  "well, I can get one for .59c , so I will eat a cake"	0
1	This is nice but why more than we think? Is there a lack of communication?	I can only speak for myself, but it's not a lack of communication. It's not having the words to fully express the depth of what we feel	0
1	Could you give us a source on that?	Of course : https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltnietzel/2020/09/09/low-literacy-levels-among-us-adults-could-be-costing-the-economy-22-trillion-a-year/?sh=10228a44c904	0
1	Yes. They're trying to move my property into the category of "Our Property" and we're now suddenly negotiating how much their take is. Of my property!	Jesus you’ve just described my sister. What’s mine is her’s and what’s her’s is her’s	0
1	That defeats the point of the passport tho. That's like filling out 'non-binaty' on a medical form. The bill doesn't make sense.	What do you think the point of the sex info is on the passport is?	0
1	The government hasn’t given us a reason to trust them. They don’t represent us.	2 years of Covid and you can’t find a reason to not trust the gov?	0
1	A city is a destination for cars and trucks, not a means of travel. Cities should be built for people. That's why we have highways.	You should become a civil engineer then, clearly it’s as simple as “fuck cars”	0
1	I am setting myself up to leave if I can. Hopefully another 4-5 years.	Yea? Any plan where you will go? What you will do?	0
1	Where is this?	Op posts in r/dagestan so I’m assuming he’s from there. It’s a region in the Russian parts of the Caucasus mountains	0

1	Everything pointing to another recession or even depression. Less goooooo	Damn that sucks. Didn't we just have a recession under Trump?	0
1	There’s a reason why these governors of large states such as New York and California do what they’re doing and the only conclusion is that they’re deliberately trying to ruin the The economy of the states for reasons I have no understanding of	I believe these cities/states are run by the UN now. That's why they do stupid stuff.	0
1	Do you instinctively think everyone who posts here seeks attention?	Yup. Or are you talking just to hear the sound of your own voice?	0
1	It's a city in the states somewhere - that's about it.	I had a stroke reading that	0
1	And yet they still work for her….	I imagine she would make it hard for them to get another job if they quit.	0
1	NTA it’s great you do so much but there should be five and take. She’s only taking it seems.	Regardless it doesn’t feel even close to even.	0
1	What would even happen if your mother found out?	I got kicked out temporarily as a 17 year old, I have to hide every single evidence of any videos on Islam or my Quran, she’s taking my Quran, and maybe the bibles and the computer depending on what happens And pretend that I am orthodox	0
1	Who is making $100K and living paycheck to paycheck? That’s simply stupid. That much money is more than enough to live on while tucking some away for savings and investments.	You must be single with no young kids, living in a cheap town	0
1	NTA but it sounds like he’s frustrated about money issues. Exactly how long have you not been working?	If it were money he's worried about he wouldn't/shouldn't have gone out for dinner.	0
1	Massive inflation right now is entirely driven by supply chain problems. Not money supply.	Pumping liquidity into a market that has no goods to purchase increases demand while decreasing or keeping flat supply. What do you think this does to prices?	0
1	800,000 out of how many?  That's so immaterial that it could be a rounding error.	Is there a percentage that would make you take notice and want to do something?  I get the feeling there isn't really and you would move the goalpost to somewhere else, but perhaps I misunderstand your position.	0
1	Why they do what	Why PD’s pair female officers with a male colleague.	0
1	Or they could use that money for a healthcare program, or the education system, the infrastructure, anything but the military and police really	But! There are defense contractors not paying negative tax rates!!!	0
1	So we need to eliminate housing markets, loans, privatized healthcare, privatized education… while in principle I don’t necessarily disagree with what you’re getting at, can you see how this statement is far too broad to be useful?	>So we need to eliminate housing markets, loans, privatized healthcare, privatized education…  now you're getting it	0
1	A better place to live for its people? Seriously?	Yeah, life expectancy was way lower and poverty way higher under Batista. I haven't heard anyone much trying to deny that.	0
1	I’d teleport into bank vaults and never work again.	cartel money deaddrops and vaults are definitely gonna be less secure than banks	0
1	Parents are literally killing their children hoping to get better material prosperity as a result. The comparison is apt in many cases.	I mean, a lot of the times people get abortions to avoid dying.	1
1	Probably not. If there is, I’ve not heard about it	Other countries are discreet about their loss to fauna.	0
1	Renter's insurance is crazy cheap for what it covers. Do it now.	I got it through Geico. (car ins is with them) I went around and tallied up everything and picked out my plan. Because I now have two policies, my car insurance dropped. 😀	0
1	Rent here jumped from $950 to over $1350! It's crazy!	I'm in Ontario. That's pretty much exactly what it went up around here. I was getting ready to move out when the pandemic happened, then rent skyrocketed... I'm still fucking stuck here.	0
1	They can’t reach the US- at least not the Atlantic	Who told you that? They are wrong, since Russia has sub launched missiles as well. There is a reason that US Attack Submarines patrol the coastal waters of the US as well as shadowing Russian Boomers in the Arctic regions.	0
1	I'm confused as to why this is even still being discussed.	Because it is still relevant and the talking point is being used to try making voting harder and disenfranchise people from voting at all. Also, it is a rallying point for Republicans for future elections.	0
1	Renter's insurance is crazy cheap for what it covers. Do it now.	We paid like 75 bucks a year. It was crazy cheap	0
1	I let them live now as long as they don't build a web right next to my bed or crawl on me. I've told them this many times and have marked my territory for them many more times. If they don't learn it's not my fault.	Same. My bro spidey is cool when she's in my corner, eating th occasional bugs in my room, but she gets sprayed of she's around my bed.	0
1	This bill is stressing me out. My kids have to deal with this one day. Breaks my heart for them.	Had another kid two weeks ago. Had this same thought.	0
1	What if the modern world takes advantage of your money? Have you thought about that	Idk about them but healthcare is free in my country. Fortunately I live in a progressive country that cares about its citizens.	0

1	Better idea: let’s just cancel any monetary debt we have to repay to China as restitution, call it even.	This is a profoundly dumb idea.	0
1	Unfortunately, the questions are much bigger than that, I believe. We've been getting the tech filtering into society, it's the who's, the he what's and the why's that I want to know.	The rich and powerful, the truth, and because those in power only fear losing that power.	0
1	Better idea: let’s just cancel any monetary debt we have to repay to China as restitution, call it even.	It's not gonna happen lol.	0
1	How about just sending them home?	Nah, a private prison make about $50 a day per inmate. It's "free" money	0
1	Not going to happen. If a third party starts it will be led by a foreign country. Take Jill Stein or Kanye for example.	Thanks to the likes of fake newsing propagandists who say, "Not going to happen, because Jill Stein."	0
1	Every time I get one I’m out for three days. I can’t afford to get them every few months at this rate.	Me too	0
1	They will wish they did after we get into an authoritarian rule. Their lives are about to down to absolute shit	Many people’s lives are already shit. It’s not a winning argument to say ‘Yes your lives are shit now and we’re not doing enough to make them better, but the other guys will make it EVEN MORE shit.’	0
1	Came here to say this. It’s over used in places it has no business being in in the first place.	What if i take the food thats perfectly good on its own....and wrap it in bacon?	0

1	He’s gotta get the info from someone…	Oh I dont disagree with you one bit.  I'm just saying that Nancy isn't even the one hitting the buy/sell buttons on her trading account.  That's how entitled and lazy she is.	0
1	Why should they thrive on our hard times?	While they’re all simultaneously saying “we’re in this together and we’ll make it through”	0
1	Yes, in fact, they do.	wut? White people were enslaved because they were white? White people were victims of segregation? White people were called racial slurs **before twitter**?  &#x200B;  I don't think so.	0
1	I'm from the UK and can confirm it's a thing here, too	Interesting.   Edit: I wasn't being sarcastic, I genuinely find the whole phenomenon interesting and am surprised to know some European countries have this practice too.	0
1	Not surprising, but what good does this do now?	The Supreme Court would have to establish precedent because there is none. That or civil war.	0
1	Those people are so far outta touch from reality I think it's a good thing.	It's all those fumes they huff from their cauldrons.	0
1	The United States of America. I have lived here my entire life so it would be impossible to travel to the country as a visitor.  Other than that, I'm down to go anywhere.	It’s a shit hole.	0
1	It's representative of where he's at right now. That's all I was trying to show.	why am I being downvoted for sharing an article. I wanted to start a civil discussion regarding current affairs.	0
1	NTA however you’re making generalisations about one group of people.	As a POC who has been fetishized and racially targeted, it’s safer to make a generalization. It’s no different than a woman that has to stay cautious around men because yes it’s it all of them, but it’s safer.	0
1	..You show me proof that there isn’t a federal mandate for truckers to be vaxxed in order to cross the border.	Like I said, what would that look like?  Who would have to say what to prove this?	0
1	Where's the man?	He's the one getting charged with Rape for consensual sex.	0
1	When I want a free vacation in gonna just walk over the southern border.	Good luck getting back.	0
1	If I can vote for higher taxes but don’t have to pay those taxes why wouldn’t I?  Especially if those taxes are going to an entitlement for me.	You didn't answer my question.	0
1	Better idea: let’s just cancel any monetary debt we have to repay to China as restitution, call it even.	Fine. China stops manufacturing cheap goods for the US. We literally can’t operate the country without Chinese products.  It would be good in the long run but VERY painful short term.	0
1	Welp. That's terrifying. We're not even safe inside our cars.	Yep. Make sure to keep the windows up. :(	0
1	Not really what I was asking.	I don’t care? It’s relevant.   You can’t claim the moral high ground of getting a person fired for sexism if you’re also sexist.	0
1	Im from a second world country where's the option	ex soviet union?	0
1	They'll do the same thing to the border guard too.	They don't do that to border guards because the US has RICO	0

1	And people think this can’t happen in America…	Can…and probably will…sadly	0
1	Well if there's anything I can help with it might be best to message me directly as this has grown a bit more than I expected.	Very thankful for your offer.	0
1	You could just tax it when they come back to the United States, unless they rescind their citizenship but if they do that they would lose all privileges connected to citizenship.	>  You could just tax it when they come back to the United States,   ...so never.	0
1	NTA  He’s looking to abandon responsibilities, not be pampered. It’s very self centered and juvenile. I hope he comes to his senses.	He's already abandoned responsibilities. OP must have very low self esteem to stay married to this loser.	0
1	No I meant like if the 13 colonies had had the same representation ratio we have(1:700,000ish) in us now it would have been a continental congress of 5 people. Europe seems to be slightly more represented.	If you want better representation, we need ranked choice voting.  We also clearly need some manner of undoing this Q cult, as it is literally as popular as some mainstream religions.  I fear its inseparable from evangelical protestantism.	0
1	It's life. It's a future citizen. Maybe we should start categorizing them as citizens when development starts, that's a genius idea.	Let me ask you a question. There’s a burning building, and in this building, there’s a jar with 120 embryos and an 18-month old baby. You can only save one. What do you save?	0
1	Yeah, Mexico is a degenerate and dangerous nation. No US asylum seeker or immigrant should be forced to remain there. The US is a nation of immigrants, to treat these immigrants as less than human goes against everything that makes the US great	Violent sure, but degenerate?! Aaaand of course you are a fucking Trumpet or troll.	1
1	Doing more than our government is	Pretty low bar.	0
1	There was no attack on the capital. They opened the doors.	Are you delusional or misinformed	0
1	Made the cartoon to soon. Should of been a border crisis cherry on top.	No, because the border crisis was first. I feel like every single thing that he does is a cover-up for something else. We've got border crisis, Afghanistan pull out, and then vaccine mandate.	0
1	They are voting against their own self interest due to propaganda in my opinion.	You really believe that everyone who doesn't vote the way you do only don't do so because they're too stupid to realize they should?	0
1	I'm looking at the latest EIA report.   What are you looking at?	Carbon numbers.	0
1	We currently have a labor shortage. Labor shortages drive inflation. Immigration helps to alleviate labor shortages and actually increase jobs in the long term.	The one moment employees get a decent bargaining position should be crushed by immigration	0
1	So a foreign leader doing a better job in his office than him.	Be more specific.  Are you talking about Boris Johnson or Xi Jinping?	0
1	Is it not coercion when the penalty for not working for many people is loss of shelter or food security? Are we not coerced into paying taxes? If you were not penalized for not paying taxes, would you choose to still pay them?	If it meant the roads where fixed and maintenance of all essential infrastructure yea I’d pay	0
1	About what?  I don't even know what you're talking about here	There’s an episode where she wants to date a famous actor but finds out he’s dating someone, but then you find out it’s fabricated by the movie studios.	0
1	Got a source?	It was Ellen Pence that admitted it in the nineties. I can't find the actual quote but it's mentioned in the link below:  https://equi-law.uk/duluth-model/	0
1	Really because I believe our current country was  born from many European nations try to conquer this land. Please take that at face value.	What European nation is non-white	0
1	The basic premise of your post is flawed, because borders are not the same thing as nations. Nations existed long before borders, nation-states, and nationalism, and if all those things disappeared nations would still exist.	>People do not need borders to identify with their nation.  Interesting point, but it would be a world without national identities. Are you saying national identities would simply re-form instead of color being the thing?	0
1	A family vacation? Why is everyone painting it this way instead of a trip to see a dying grandparent?	You make an excellent point.	0
1	Some people think there's no propaganda in the west? News to me.	Yeah, more than some people think there's no propaganda in the West. And some people acknowledge there is propaganda, but they'd be able to spot it.  I don't actually think that's news to you though.	0
1	I'm afraid they are partly to blame.	How so?	0
1	You are catching on. The one percent looks at the 99 parent as part of their estate. Something they own. You are at their mercy. At least up until recently they controlled most of us with fear and intimidation tactics.	Just find out where they live then we will see who is at who's mercy. (not serious)  Although if the 99% really wanted we could just end most of the 1%.	0
1	Made the cartoon to soon. Should of been a border crisis cherry on top.	Yup. Now talibidens FAA is not allowing drones to fly over certain areas of the southern border. Trying to limit what the public can see?	0
1	Or I just have better things to do.	Yeah I can tell by reading all the hatefull shit you're posting about men all over this thread.	0
1	Men can’t be genuine refugees?	Apparently not. One must apparently posess a vagina or prepubescent body...	0
1	That's not getting into the 15 to 25k it costs to become a citizen. People born in America don't know how good they have it.	We are fortunate for sure. 18 years is WAY too long of a time.	0
1	Veteran here.   It sucks, but a draft is necessary for a country to remain strong.  Also, please don't send women, they are terrible on deployments.	Veteran here. No it isn't.	0
1	I honestly think there could be	It seems very unlikely without making a lot of assumptions. What makes you think so?	0
1	That’s kind of our own fault by allowing virtually all of our manufacturing to be done overseas. We need a manufacturing revolution here in the US.	No, like the PPE was literally *bought in the US, and then sent to China*. It's not a "fault of our manufacturing" - it's China buying up the domestic supply.	0
1	It’s a product of overproduction, neo-colonialism, imperialism, artificial created scarcity to drive up prices and all of these things are by products of neo-liberal capitalism.	I know it's not because of over population or food shortage, there is more than enough for everyone on this Earth to live comfortably. You just have greedy people who have taken the shares of millions.	0
1	They want all the privileges and none of the responsibility	That's not exclusive to feminist women.	1
1	Might have something to do with the dementia I’m guessing	I don't understand why you're getting downvoted, it's the most logical explanation.	0
1	Uh, actually the US is more of a prisoner island, since you literally lock up more people per-capita than any other country by a mile.	We have a lot of people who choose to commit crime.	1
1	My advise is to not tell them. They don’t need to know.	I completely agree with this! Would it bother you if he blabbed this to others (as many men do)? If so, don’t take the risk of telling him.	0
1	Yes. They never wanted to have a borderless nation, and they've edited the relevant Wikipedia and news articles to prove it.	And the parties switched somehow, they weren’t for slavery and against civil rights.  They are rather insistent on passing any and all of their sins on to others.	0
1	Sending it in private	Could you dm it to me too?	0
1	I am sick to fucking death of these people.	They have no respect for reality in any form. They deal exclusively in lies and hide behind free speech and press to actively weaken America. No law should protect these charlatans who do nothing but sow their poisonous seeds in gullible minds.	0
1	All of them?	Why do I not see Star Wars?	0
1	Men can’t be genuine refugees?	These aren't, they are looking for a soft option.	0
1	It’d be more useful if you came in here with receipts instead of emotionally charged arguments short on actual information.	Are you actually serious.  You actually need a receipt to show government waste. Are you actually screwing with me or are you practicing your stand up routine.	0
1	They aren't really relevant to this post.	Oh ok	0
1	The way they treated their natives was fucking awful but it's one of the best countries to live in, many personal freedoms, not densely populated, etc	Maybe Canada should have just killed them all like America did.   At least we are actively trying to make things better	0
1	The headline is misleading as well. It bans STATE SPONSORED travel, meaning the citizens can go wherever, it’s just not going to be paid for by their stupid government.	CommieFornia ✔️	0
1	Just a question, where is OP emigrating from? Your English is amazing. Spelling, grammar, etc. far exceeds that of most college educated native born Americans. When I say most, I mean like, 99%..	I am from Wales and came here for my post-grad work. Language can be a form of art where I come from. Just pop in any local on a Friday night.	0
1	No more than the US .. separating kids from refugee families, and "losing" a lot of them...	That's like not even in the same realm of the conversation.	0
1	The length of the contract is one year. I’m staying here for a couple more of years. I renovated my contract before this happened. Technically I can leave but I’d still have to pay the rent here and in the new place.  I can’t afford that.	I think you mean you renewed your contract. Renovating is when you make improvements to a property. Maybe talk to the landlord and explain his request has put you in a negative situation? He may decide to let you out of your contract without penalty.	0
1	Yeah, and it's worse for foreigners who *aren't* white. We take anti-descrimination laws for granted here in the west.	It’s not just white, mixed race Japanese kids also got bullied in schools	0
1	Miscalculated in what way? Is he implying that we will attack Russia?	have you seen the response?	0
1	The whole world is a big scam.	Royal family's. There extended in groups actually run the world taking advantage of us all.	0
1	My point is That the taxpayers should decide what the money is spent on and under what rules.   Is that okay?	We do. We elect representatives.  They decide.   Then when their term is over,  we decide if they did good, or not.   You seem to want mob rule.  It's terribly inefficient,  and not American.	0
1	Rent here jumped from $950 to over $1350! It's crazy!	Me and my girlfriend got extremely lucky and pay $650 a month in a rather safe town.	0
1	And by "diplomats" they include a certain portion salesforce.	It's not like we have any need of salesmen there at all when Russia is already providing clingy of demand for American made weapons.	0
1	Would that not solve the problem here?	Maybe	0
1	Another state to add to my list of places not to visit	Half the country is about to have permitless carry and most of the country has shall issue conceal carry. Unless you live in new york city or LA you probably walk by several people legally carrying guns everyday.	0
1	Better idea: let’s just cancel any monetary debt we have to repay to China as restitution, call it even.	Wow.  That would be awesome.	0
1	How sad that European kids learned more about colonization than us Canadians.	Albertan curriculum (current, not the new one) covers indigenous people in depth. We started covering residential schools in fifth grade, and even now, in eleventh grade, we are learning about residential schools, colonization, and the head tax	0
1	You know Europe is not just one big country right?   Go back to the US	Very aware. But I won’t be more specific than to say a country in Western Europe.	0
1	And yet there’s still hundreds of deaths a year. Clearly, people are keeping information in the dark.	Based on what statistics?	0
1	Cause South Texas's gonna be crawling with illegal immigrants under Biden's border policy	Lol you say that like it isn’t already. They are already running around the Hill Country with huge backpacks full of drugs, destroying property en masse.	0
1	But they did, they do, and they will never stop. Still, you're allowed to blame and punish only Russia, quite convenient.	the US lost a lot for its invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan.  The people of both those countries lost more.  Russia will likely lose a lot in this invasion, too.  not sure what you mean by "allowed to blame and punish"	0
1	How do we know if they're real or fake?	why would they be fake? most of them who post stuff like that use throwaway accounts so people wouldn’t be able to see their real accounts, for some reason.	0
1	We are arguing the same point and are on the same side. You get paid for the job you do and at a rate appropriate for how much money you bring in.	Yeah so why is there a need to argue with me. We’re making the same point.	0

1	So basically the sanctions have done fuck all, again.  Fuck sake. So much for the West making Russia pay for its invasion.	Nope, just ignore the man behind the curtain (manipulating their currency value to look way better than it is)	0

1	Did they?	Absolutely, every car show I go to they still say carburetors are superior to fuel injection.	0
1	Tax subsidies help. Terrible living conditions help also.	Also, if retailers get people in the door by advertising crazy low turkeys prices, they make their money when those people do the rest of their shopping there.	0
1	Better idea: let’s just cancel any monetary debt we have to repay to China as restitution, call it even.	I'm not really an expert on economics at all but doesn't that significantly decrease trust and confidence in the USD?  I know lots of currencies across the world are pegged to the USD	0
1	You realize he’s not going anywhere right? Do you think he didn’t use his intelligence connections to get blackmail on people before he left office?	He's a f****** moron	0
1	Oh no of course they picked up on it! It'd be naive to think otherwise.	Then you’re less naive than OP	0
1	You think firing tens of millions of people won’t have consequences? The economy is already in shambles, that would just bring it to total collapse. They can’t afford to make such a mistake.	I’m sure those tens of millions of people will just get the vaccine to avoid losing everything they’ve worked for. Just like our friends at Fox News, who are all mostly vaxxed.	0
1	It’s insane to watch these people who don’t understand how to use basic technology of our daily lives make laws to govern us.	View Source <-- Arrest that hacker!!!	0
1	It’s working why wouldn’t they keep doing it	Exactly, “So this is how liberty dies—with thunderous applause?”	0
1	The French Revolution also had a functional opposition, and 60% of the French weren't pretending that they were temporarily displaced royals.	And they were spending between 50-80% of their daily income on bread (running up to it). When food becomes too difficult to get people have Jo choice but to turn to violence	0
1	I mean we don’t need their exact tax returns or anything. But like find someone close. Someone on the face of it hasn’t gained that money through exploitation. We don’t need to dig deep, just on the face of it.	The answer is you and I do not agree on what is exploitation.	0
1	It’s insane to watch these people who don’t understand how to use basic technology of our daily lives make laws to govern us.	Like Ted Stevens' understanding of the internet during the net neutrality debates?  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Series_of_tubes	0
1	That’s why the UK is in decline with an out of control immigration problem and no-go zones that the local bobbies don’t even patrol.   So, probably a bad example	It's not only UK. In the whole EU, citizens from other EU countries can vote in local elections in the countries they have their main residence in.	0
1	How would they force you	Peer pressure is a hell of a drug	0
1	We’ve been getting bombarded by “Visit Canada..the Home of Winter!” tourism ads lately.   I guess that’s money wasted…	> We’ve been getting bombarded by “Visit Canada..the Home of Winter!” tourism ads lately.  But...

1	He’s adding sanctions right now?	No hes not he got rid off all the previous ones	0
1	And the US is a military threat to the entire world.	Of course. But how does that relate to the question of why the US might step into this war but not any of the other ongoing wars?	0
1	Is that why I’m making $10 over minimum wage without a bit of job training or education? It’s called advancing your career and leveraging skills for higher wages.  Yes, it involves hard work and moving jobs/locations	Lol, I just walked into Amazon and didn't even need a resume. I'm now making $12.80 over minimum wage with zero experience needed and no leveraging skills. It sounds like you are working your ass off and not getting any benefit...	0
1	Do you think our culture is heading in the right direction?	I think in some ways, but not in all.	0
1	No, they don't.	Yes they do. They make it harder to move your hands freely. Not by very much. But they do.	0
1	They actually don't know if you got donations, medical expenses, tax sheltered investment contributions, capital losses, tuition write-offs, and so on and so forth.	Agree, I just like to read people’s comments and see how out of touch they’re from reality.	0
1	You’re assuming they care about their employees	Then on the nearest door greeter or security guard.	0
1	They always do for some reason.	I mean, I'm not surprised. That's lifelong male entitlement for you.	0
1	How are we here ten years later	Well for me, I’m watching the Tyson documentary and was curious what people thought about the situation	0
1	Thankfully the EU isn't buying his bullshit	Thankfully he came out in support of Ukraine.  Broken  clock	0
1	This is one of the reasons why I regret making the first move in the past. Made it too easy and convenient. They’ll just take what they can get.	I second this.	0
1	I literally pay our rent bill.	Go to the office as soon as you have time. like wow.	0
1	How sad that European kids learned more about colonization than us Canadians.	My Canadian education covered both culture, history etc and then in later years colonization.	0
1	They don’t have to have a plan. Their base doesn’t demand tangible benefits for putting them in office. It only demands they hurt their perceived enemies.	Their base will believe whatever they want them to believe that day.	0
1	You’d think immigration reform was some kind despicable socialist thing the way its talked about here.	Not quite. Secure the board and use the manpower and funds saved by having a manageable area to increase throughput of legal immigrants. I don’t want Carlos the cartel member I want a gentleman like in this post in America.	0
1	The way they treated their natives was fucking awful but it's one of the best countries to live in, many personal freedoms, not densely populated, etc	The way they are still treating their indigenous persons IS fucking awful****  Just helping you out.	0
1	That's actually a good idea.	Thanks	0
1	That's only part of it. The US was a net exporter under Trump. We now have to import.	Does not really matter other than a headline in today’s world.  Sure we export more than we use, but that is only really helpful in an imbargo. Oil is sold on the world market at world market price.	0
1	The problem we have now here in CO is unelected county bureaucrats have taken it upon themselves to reinstate mask mandates.  Of course I cheerfully ignore them.	I believe he addressed this in his speech, something along the lines of unelected officials do not have the authority to tell the public what they must wear. If that is accurate then I believe it opens the door for lawsuits to get rolling.	0
1	Rent here jumped from $950 to over $1350! It's crazy!	My decent 1 br apartment went from $1100 to $1550 this year.  Insanity	0
1	It's state by state.	Boy it's really going to make people rethink where you live.  You're going to see a srs shift in state economy after this divide.	0
1	We are far from “overpopulated” we are just wasteful with our recourses and lazy with how we use the land to provide.	That’s a wild point. This small house with a 1000 people in it isn’t really over crowed it just needs all the walls knocked down and expanded bc of poor design…	0
1	He is ruining the country one day at a time	Not saying you are wrong (I'm not a fan of Biden either). Just curious what specifically you feel Biden has fucked up?	0
1	That’s a really low tax rate… do all Americans who earn this much income pay this rate?	That’s the effective rate. He paid different rates for different levels of income. This is how a progressive tax system works.	0
1	Funny I met a "once very-rare" California refugee today in Palm Beach County. He said Cali was beautiful but it was impossible to live there. Homeless and crime everywhere	Did you him the error of his ways?	0
1	we would have thousands of boots on the ground… backing Russia	Actually you're probably right. I definitely overestimated Trumps intelligence while cultivating that theory	0
1	Don't be that naive. If an entire military base or air force base breaks away, they will have everything they need to fight an active war.	Not for long.	0
1	Things will turn out fine.	Good advice especially in these days! It all works out.	0
1	After reading through this thread, my only conclusion is that America is in trouble.	I'm starting to wonder which countries will take refugees after the Second Civil War breaks out. Canada explicitly disallows refugee status if you're an American citizen, and I wonder how quickly that would/could change.	0
1	So he wants to force every American to take it but people coming into the country don't have to?	Same shit in canada	0
1	Not at all the same concept.  Not abiding to pay taxes has legal ramifications. And you still haven't told me where you got 15% from.	Are you agreeing you’re a free rider if you don’t tip?	0
1	They are	Knew it. Happy Cake Day!	0
1	Why not pay your taxes instead?	So it can go to blowing up people?	0
1	We need troops on the Polish border with Belarus and Ukraine, and on the Romanian border with Ukraine.	And in Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia on their border with Russia.	0
1	A birth rates in Europe are low  B it's easier to stop people immigrating than it is to stop them fucking	it may be easier but that doesn’t make it right	1
1	Don't know, I don't live there.	People make/convert guns in the uk as well, but they are extremely expensive and very prone to misfire or fail. A far cry from US guns	0
1	Nothing says “dreams come true” like homeless encampments under every over pass coupled with the highest tax rate AND unemployment rate in the country.  Been here 34 years, the state is beyond repair with many many many things.	Homeless encampments under overpasses is not unique to CA.  Paying more taxes isn’t necessarily a bad thing.  We also have the highest GDP in the country.  Please stop speaking for us.	0
1	So because they can’t complain, they don’t have rights? That’s complete bullshit.	They don't have rights because they don't hide rights.	0
1	Alien is also = a foreigner, especially one who is not a naturalized citizen of the country where they are living. So basically, citizens of Earth.   From the Oxford dictionary.	OP is taking about space and other life forms. They even said so. People from another country aren't another life form from space, obviously	0
1	Seems like an entirely different situation	Lots of people in these comments are presenting other reasons to be on a couch.	0
1	This country absolutely sickens me some days	Leave?	0
1	Now with the latest migrant movements they started to on some borders yes but you only need an id card not a passport necessarily. And the Uk of course was always excluded because they wanted to	Take this from someone who used to pendle across the danish-german border: They CAN accept other valid ID than passport. But legally, it has to be a valid, unexpired passport	0
1	I'm not sure posting here is the right thing for you. I wish you all the best.	Thank you very much.	0
1	Sounds like it'll be their problem then. Maybe they're brutal enough to stabilize it, maybe it'll waste their time like it did ours.	They don't need to stabilize it, they just need to make sure their next door neighbor isn't a stable American ally	0
1	And when they sell them too?	Selling something is irrelevant to whether or not they are adults.	0
1	All of them.	no fun	0
1	Yes, but living in a free country,  I am not willing to stifle the will of the people. Are you suggesting we alter the will of the people from the supply side?	We already do! Do you think people consume more gas because 1/3 of the cost is provided by the government, same with soda… same with everything we provide at reduced costs.	0
1	They also give much less of a shit about their soldiers than we do.	Not really. They also lost more already than they did in the entirety of the Chechen war.	0
1	I can’t imagine any other foreign power doing this kind of thing to be honest. It makes us look absolutely pathetic and pandering to a screeching minority.	Yeah we look awful to the rest of the world right now	0
1	Where is this from?	I think it's from the movie "Zola".	0
1	How would they force you	There IS harassing you to play by constant nagging.	0
1	They won’t say anything at all.	That was pretty much my point	0
1	Lack of supply is the main reason prices are so high. We don't have enough housing to match demand.	Flat out untrue. Not even close to reality.	0
1	Maybe, helping them would be a better option?	Why don’t you?	0
1	It’s the same in America, but we live in a country where almost no one understands how taxes are spent; and most people unanimously vote for anything that has increased spending on ballots. Out buttholes are gaping.	And they don't even bother to use lube! Or a reach around for fucks sake...	0
1	The domestic side of federal government has gotten tremendously more efficient over the past 5 decades as that side lags in government spending gains.	Again, meaningless. Budget cuts, by definition, reduce spending.	0
1	I never said they don't. That's why they can find a way if they want to.	Ah but you would try to restrict it if you could. And you'd take it away altogether if you could.	0
1	Coming where? At work?	🤣 no to this sub. I'm grown and can control myself	0
1	My advise is to not tell them. They don’t need to know.	What if you’re waiting for marriage?	0
1	But I thought your argument was that it was a right? How many people die from taking out a loan?	Voting is a right, “buying a gun” is not a right. “Taking out a loan” is not a right.	0
1	This country absolutely sickens me some days	There are shootings literally every day in America; albeit rarely this tragic	0
1	Can I get a list of the other countries so I know where to invest?	Kazakhstan for the win!!	0
1	This just made it seem a lot closer than thinking "it's a couple of months away"	True lol 😂	0
1	We don't serve their kind here.	The ability to speak does not make you (Xtian, not you) intelligent.	0
1	As a parent of a month old, it is bullshit that baby formula is going to illegal immigrants over citizens  That's how I feel and I don't care if that's a hot take	It was a recall, it has been on the news since February.  That's not a hot take that's a shit take, btw.	0
1	And your parents? Did they bring something home from the Capitol storming?	what a myopic world view you have hahaha	0
1	None of my business? been talking to this person for a few days now. It is my business.	Obviously aren’t at the point where that is something they feel the need to share.  This was such an entitled answer I honestly hope they tell you to piss off	0
1	What country do you live in?	Turkey.	0
1	Because many people build them for the purpose of posting here.	If the account is new there is no way of knowing who it is. They will create the account then they will troll once let in. And if it gets banned, they don't care.	0
1	We couldn’t “stop” them but I doubt a small raise in taxes would convince every single billionaire to stop doing business here. Some, sure, but not the majority.	What is the estimated amount that would cover tuition of all college students in the US?	0
1	Why don't we bus them back to Mexico, though?	Because in every case they are bussing people who want to go somewhere else.  It’s a win win for the involved parties. Local government gets its brownie points with an eye catching headline, and they get to go where they want.	0
1	Another state to add to my list of places not to visit	Are Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, South Dakota, North Dakota, Montana, Wyoming, Idaho, Utah, Arizona and Alaska also on that list?	0
1	You can't just cancel loans though surely? Would the Government in this case simply just buy the debt?	They own the debt already. “Federal” student loans.	0
1	I hoped I’d find support here	You are acting like a religious folk who hates other people just because they don't follow his religion. You have become the very thing you swore to destroy.	0
1	We’re staying at in laws for Christmas and I don’t have my own family so not really. I’m grateful for their help when I need it. I just snapped at that moment	I don't know if anyone else suggested this, but our first Christmas I wore my baby in one of those wraps so that no one could just snatch her from me and I was able to keep full use of my hands. Might be something that works for you.	0
1	They need to align themselves with Poland and Hungary. They are the only three countries with any common sense in the EU.	Austria and Denmark as well I would say.	0
1	And for how many illegal immigrants? How many did they even find? You know it's all performance art bs. But that's actually mean to say about performance art, which can be interesting and sometimes even thought provoking.	>And for how many illegal immigrants? How many did they even find?   By their own admission they found not one illegal immigrant and not one instance of illegal drugs being discovered in these inspections.	0
1	Couldn't this be passed through budget reconciliation?	Lets fucking hope not. But very likely.	0
1	what they’re putting in that capsule does NOT reflect us whatsoever	It reflects them perfectly. The useful idiots supporting wannabe tyrants.	0
1	Oh, that is why they did this. It makes sense now.	Doesn’t really make sense…..where exactly can they run to?  They are surrounded by like minded countries!	0
1	18 fucking years.   But let's provide amnesty to folks who slap this guy in the face by cutting the line and claiming "asylum".	People push for illegal immigration in the name of asylum, when in reality *actual* asylum cases are few and far between.	1
1	Sounds like the oppression of billions of people to me.	Nothing new.	0
1	I put in the effort to make sure things are paid on time without me we would be so far in a hole.	But you don't need anymore money coming in? You cant have it both ways.	0
1	Why should they thrive on our hard times?	What if they helped us get through it?	0
1	I could get onboard with this.	That would be a boss ass duo.	0
1	It is fine because I have been starting to not give a shit about them either.	Still not fine though	0
1	You should never go back to where? Not sure I understand.	Sorry I'd never go back to the USA.  I gave up my visa and quit and moved back home.	0
1	I feel your opinion would not be welcome in my work placed. Policies are actively being pushed to make us ever more available, and I've been given a work phone for the explicit or purpose of making sure I'm always reachable.	I feel gross just reading this.  What is with workplaces believing they have the right, no, the imperative to lord over all of our time?!?  I’m sorry you’re dealing with this.	0
1	Travel and wildlife photographer.	Oh that would be so cool	0
1	stuff about the the early settlers, colonisation, the slave trade, the civil war, also mormons for some reason?	Joseph Smith was called a prophet, dum dum dum dum dum! Many people believed Joseph, dum dum dum dum dum!	0
1	Hopefully they will learn something valuable from this thread. There seems to be a few of them lurking on here judging from the downvotes it's gotten.	In my experience most people aren't actively seeking to disprove their own beliefs but on the contrary seek to reinforce them. Like the old saying goes, most people just want to hear their own opinions out of someone else's mouth.	0
1	Is this a for real thing now? We've now got to worry about people sneaking up behind us to inject us with drugs?	Scary shit. Glad people that go to rock/metal shows aren’t gang banging turds...I don’t have to worry about this shit.	0
1	Crossing over to the civilian world from the military.	Totally legit. Civilians are frightening creatures... and complain about crap that would never be noticed in the military.  Do NOT be afraid to seek counseling - doesn't matter if you've seen combat or not.	0
1	Never once? Are you, perhaps, not from America?	Lol you're right) I'm from Russia!	0
1	Take care of yourself or let the taxpayers do it? Ah yes, everyone will choose the “free” stuff when given the choice.	I'm already paying for other people's kids with my taxes. Birth control is cheaper than food stamps and WIC and abortion is wrong. I'm just trying to do the math on what costs me less.	0
1	They didn't go in at all.	Didn't the shooter shoot himself?	0
1	Right, but that's why I started off assuming that the colonists would fund it themselves.  Look, ultimately I just want my own planet all for me where I can be the king and set whatever rules I want. Is that so much to ask?	I'll chip in a few bucks for weekend privileges.  Timeshares are a bad idea, but if it's on another planet i'll make an exception.	0
1	I look forward to Federal Law Enforcement taking this clear cut case of human trafficking and doing absolutely nothing about it.	Nobody is above the law. /s	0
1	I was raised in poverty by my immigrant parents. According to a lot of these people, I would've theoretically been better off dead.	>I was raised in poverty by my immigrant parents.

1	Who is it from again?	Margaret Atwood I think	0
1	Does this post recognize that there are 200+ countries in the world or, for the purposes of this post, does the world end at the US border?	I am from the US, yes, but I do not see how this wouldn't be applicable to other countries?	0
1	Yeah. It seems the economic backlash is more towards the other country, more so than China.  But I might be wrong. Just looks that way.	One on one, maybe. But cumulatively if all countries imposed sanctions it may actually have an effect.	0
1	People can do whatever they want. Just don't expect me or anyone else to pay for it	What is it that you think people are expecting you to pay for by freezing payments on student loans? You do realize that is the topic you’re directly replying to, right?	0
1	I have mutual respect with people, not companies. We've got enough issues in the states with politicians treating corporations as people. We don't need to start doing it as citizens too.	Mega-corporation greed has nothing to do with giving your team, boss, or clients a two week notice that you will be moving on. Being considerate is always better in the long run.	0
1	Not here, I'll mention you soon else where.	mention me aswell, i’d look to benefit from this akhi ‏جزاك اللهُ خيراً	0
1	They vax at the border though?	Oh you poor child.	0
1	Only reason they make up the majority of refugees is because they were ALLOWED TO unlike men who were forced to stay and fight.	She mentions that, almost in passing though, and you could have the idea that the men are favoured by this given the article!	0
1	Somewhere in the Balkans or Eastern Europe.	go to russia where domestic violence is legalised.  /s	0
1	Oh, multiculturalism.  Oh, free immigration.  Oh, refugees.  What could go wrong?	What if they actually want those consequences ? They want to use them to replace their own race.	0
1	Oh we've had all that for decades.Apparently we have no culture or the culture we have is inferior (lame..) so thank the lord we have  enriched ourselves and imported "better" culture...	>thank the lord we have enriched ourselves and imported "better" culture...  If you just wanted to import better culture you should've just tried to import from Norway... They seem like they'd be much more compatible, and probably less rapey.	0
1	That’s what I’m saying. These people think because they go to tourists spots everyone can speak English. It’s Not that prevalent among normal people. Why would they need to learn English.	Even in Paris I found that some French people thought they spoke more English than they actually did... I hope some of these monolingual travellers don't find out the hard way by getting into some trouble (genuinely, I'm not being sarky)	0
1	Rent here jumped from $950 to over $1350! It's crazy!	I live in the suburbs. My neighbors sold their house to a rental agency. Their mortgage was ~$1400 a month. The agency just listed the house at $2300 a month. Fuck rent.	0
1	Sure wouldn't when I can pay others to do it.	Omg you’re so fucking dumb hahaha. Idiocracy was right lol.	0
1	Send him over to that ‘smart’ country. Then freeze whatever assets he has left in US banks.	All of $0 he has left.	0
1	It costs so much money preventing and winning wars. It costs EVERYTHING losing our country, our freedoms and our way of life.   The US Military is bigger than itself. It serves as a deterrent to a lot of aggressive countries around the world.	Lol, the last war America "won" ended in 1953.	0
1	Guarantee she’d rat her dad out without a second thought	No no don’t jinx us cmon now	0
1	Back in my day we went to the post office to pickup tax forms and fill them out with our own hands.   Can you still do that?	Not in my county, or my mother’s- but you can go to the library and pay them to print.   Sucks.  I had to hit the bank to get change to print at the library, because I don’t effing DO cash anymore.	0
1	Don’t forget about all the billions going right into the back pockets of the same democrats who sent the “aid package” either!	Defense contractors are doing so well [they have  been able to scale back](https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2022/04/top-pentagon-contractors-spend-less-on-lobbying-as-demand-for-weapons-to-ukraine-rises/) their lobbying operations.	0

1	My wife wants us to relocate to Florida. Can you elaborate	Take our advice: Don't move there. There are not only plenty of crazy right-wing nutjobs as well as the Christian right at every turn, but also a lot of loony Republicans running the state like Ron DeSantis, Matt Gaetz & Rick Scott.	0
1	It is though.	If you actually think about it though, it's more of a dream about a lack of pipe.	0
1	I think you just call them and ask them to pick it up. the next time they're in the neighborhood they'll come by to pick it up.	Thank you. We don’t have either brands drop off near by and having to take them somewhere would just make me mad lol	0
1	Did we have any to begin with at this point?	Watch the West Wing to appreciate how much faith there was just a quarter century back	0
1	Massive inflation right now is entirely driven by supply chain problems. Not money supply.	Real question: how does pumping money have less impact on inflation than supply chain	0
1	I'm asking you for receipts. You know, data. Evidence.	Yeah, because all of them studies where feminists are stupid enough to admit they want to kill men. Stop wasting my time with this harassment.	0
1	Really because there were no issues like this, the stay in Mexico policy was working.  Or are you to stupid to actually look it up and be informed.	“No issues like this”. Right.  Everything was peachy-keen on the border.   Or are you stupid to go somewhere other than OAN or “The glorious American” for your information.	0
1	Hopefully the agents who killed that family go straight to hell.	Express elevator	0
1	Gonna be great.  Just got a nice promotion and a huge raise.  Lots of great games and movies coming out.  We are vaxxed and boosted so we're gonna travel some more.	Have an adventurous year dude	0
1	It’s honestly frightening the way some of them follow or harass us for not smiling when they ask us to.	Cue Japanese man who k\*lled women for "looking too happy."  We. Can't. Win...	0
1	It seems like your issue is with the cultural hegemony of the US drowning out the nuances of struggles in other cultures. Is that fair to say?	That is potentially the problem here, but I would argue that Critical Theory is still a false position to hold because it presuppositions are inherently divisive, and will only serve to create the very racism it supposedly wishes to combat.	0
1	No it won’t. It’s not in their job description.	Yes, it will.  If he were a functional human being, the likelihood of finding a partner will skyrocket.    a therapist will not procure a prostitute, but they will help you become a person that can attract a partner.	0
1	Not sure about that. Migration patterns, including myself indicate, that conservatives are leaving blue states in droves to red states. California leading the charge. Migration to Idaho is the number one recipient percentage wise.	There’s a difference between leaving an area with oppressive legislation (mandates, vaccine passports, taxes, gun rights) to somewhere with more liberties and refusing to associate with the other side of the aisle.	0
1	If you think this is gonna end with the US embassy on fire with several Americans dead, you’re probably right.	Then another war in Afghanistan	0
1	He has also invaded Ukraine. So not just movement of soldiers.  If NATO moved 200000 troops near the border of Russia, I know Russia would be a little scared	Like ive stated,a mastermind.	0
1	They actually don't know if you got donations, medical expenses, tax sheltered investment contributions, capital losses, tuition write-offs, and so on and so forth.	...Meanwhile, here in Germany, I can do personalized deductions for various issues even though the government does my taxes for me.

1	I don't have to meet them.	Well you're talking to one right now, ask me anything	0

1	And the governments of the world aren’t gonna do shit because money.	At this point there is literally nothing they can do that will fix it.	0
1	That defeats the point of the passport tho. That's like filling out 'non-binaty' on a medical form. The bill doesn't make sense.	> The bill doesn't make sense.  What bill are you talking about here?	0
1	Not even. It's giving people their neighbors' money.	a fraction of their neighbors money, after it's already passed through a gauntlet of sticky bureaucratic fingers.	0
1	Meanwhile the Department of Defense keeps discharging troops and not accepting requests for waiver / exemptions	Thats because the vaccine will surely shorten the life-span of the young and healthy. They want Americans to die and migrants to replace Americans.	0
1	A very long while. They won't give up cash very easily or in the short term.	How many people actually have cash though? Banks will get emptied out immediately, governments will likely hold on to what they can to maintain control but people who have no cash will start trading things/labor for food out of necessity	0
1	I mean. The supply chain issue is global. Not like we can put a spin on it to boost it. Best policy would be to start producing shit again instead of shipping it from overseas so we can be more self-sufficient	Having ships backed up because of two specific laws passed by California plus people that were paid not to work for too long plus firing people that will get the vaccine is not in any way a global issue.	0

1	The government hasn’t given us a reason to trust them. They don’t represent us.	Has America really gotten to the point where a regular citizen should carry a weapon to protect themselves from government agents?  Think you're watching a little too much FOX News.	0
1	Probably an unpopular opinion here but the recent tax haven leak has TRILLIONS of dollars stashed away. No velocity of money, not being used in the economy, just hidden away… I’m okay taxing that.	Honest question: hasn't that money already been subject to taxes?	0
1	Where are those communities now?	If you go to villages in developing countries its still like that. Even in bigger cities they have more sense of community than anywhere in US. The US is the most isolated society on Earth because of its extreme form of capitalism	0
1	I didn't know that. Why don't they expand towards California and Arizona.	It’s going to Winnipeg, so that would be way out of the way.	0
1	My point remains since they can still get it.	Except for that they are greatly benefited by getting it.	0
1	Orr… I could have bought a house but paid my loans instead, others want it forgiven for free so they can now snatch up homes which I can‘t afford.	Orrr....they can't buy a house because they have been paying student loans for years?	0
1	Nope. People run away when I tell them.	What do you say to them?	0
1	If only. If Texas or Florida would have an equivalent in Europe I would move in a heartbeat.	Poland?	0
1	Doesn't matter, because the citizens voting in the city/locality are inclusive of the federal requirement to get drafted.	Are you sure about that? Also, there are a lot of citizens that are exempt from the draft...about 50%.	0
1	But no matter what, it's still very important for us to be kind to our parents	I was just asking	0
1	New people arrive on the internet every day, gotta welcome them in	True, true.	0
1	It’s insane to watch these people who don’t understand how to use basic technology of our daily lives make laws to govern us.	And not just laws to govern us, but laws to regulate and govern the technology they don't understand.	0
1	I hoped I’d find support here	I agree with you. They are loons.	0
1	My wife and I combined have like $27k in government loans and we both have masters.  Yes we've been paying them off over the last decade but still $50k wipes is down to private loans only which is just about $10k between us.	Why can’t you pay off $27k with two masters degree?	0
1	Disagree. I’m the first one to flee and I’m a man	Am I suppose to clap for you being a chicken and a wuss? Good god, you spineless loser.	0
1	Should contact a travel agency that specializes in that	Do I need a travel agency? Cant I just do it myself?	0
1	We can't have a country if this is how we are going to treat each other.	That's the idea.	0
1	Those migrants are thanking him because he gave them a ride closer to their final destinations. Like Miami. DeSantis should thank Abbott.	No they arnt , he is lit. Scouping them up without warning or care for family units.	0
1	Although not my concern, they could build their way up by educating themselves and applying for jobs.  More convenient for me and other citizens. Not concerned with what’s convenient for society’s non-contributors	Homeless people are often citizens too.	1
1	I’m in California	I live in New Mexico & people seem to be having a hard time of it here. Maybe if you worked overtime & had a roommate/ SO to split bills. Here, rental prices have really increased lately	0
1	I can’t wait to move out of California only 9 months left of this nonsense	Lucky i have 10 months...	0
1	Don’t like it? Move back to California.	Or just… you know… be responsible when you have sex.	0
1	Good! The border needs to be secured, now!	What’s your tag stand for?	0
1	If they even reply	Why would I reply? You’re a troll.	0
1	Did we have any to begin with at this point?	I think people a generation ago did, to a large extent.	0
1	I think he means government funded	So ban all private child care and set up thousands of local government ran ones.  That’s not gonna work. 😐	0
1	Not for me	:) made me smile	0
1	Non-citizen voters get local-only ballots.  US citizens who reside overseas get federal-only ballots.	Non citizens shouldn't get ballots PERIOD. This ain't their country, they don't get voting rights.	0
1	Of course, that’s why I offered an extra day before we fly back so he can spend time with them.	I think the comment above was saying hubbie can spend more than one day with his kids - leaving you with your family for some of that time.   How would you feel about that - would you be ok with it, or did you want his support?	0
1	We care but we do not know what we care for	Ow, that's ironic, don't you think?	0
1	Have they been successful?	Yes, extremely successful on average.  Also, they wouldn't do it if it wasn't successful. Nor would anyone feel threatened by it.	0
1	What part of the country do you live in now?	Now? I live in BC, Canada. We do have tipping. I did live in Korea, Japan, Ireland and England.	0
1	Do these people ever stop war mongering? Russia hasn't invaded, but they are discussing putting up some additional sanctions now?	Ever heard of Crimea or Donbass ?	0
1	What if a group of pissed off American citizens went and looted these pallots and gave back to the American families who needed it the most	Then it would be called an “insurrection and a serious threat to democracy”.	0
1	Are we talking about people who refuse to buy them or can't afford them ?	I'm talking about people who can afford them but because they make poor life choices.	0
1	Not in the UK anymore	I believe it [still is](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2003/42/section/1). Are you aware if there is any pending amendment?	0
1	I believe these cities/states are run by the UN now. That's why they do stupid stuff.	Well that’s definitely an interesting thought exercise	0
1	This is the biggest one for me too.	I agree. I'm still shocked that people would prefer to risk death or permanent harm of themselves and others rather than temporarily give up mundane conveniences.	0
1	I don’t care.  I will never apply to work for someone like you.	They're better off without you	0
1	A lot of people here are not very understanding….	Some people here don't know what they are really talking about,, you are correct..  By the way      HAPPY CAKE DAY 🙏😊	0
1	Wouldn’t that be almost as bad as selling access or possibly making foreign policy decisions to benefit your family and not the country?	Of course not! First it's only bad when Republicans do it. Second, all that stuff about Hunter Biden is just a series of crazy coincidences!  /S in case anyone misses the obvious.....	0
1	You also have to pay all those truckers for their time waiting in a 6 mile traffic jam.  There is also the $240 million in food that went bad in the heat while waiting.  It’s not just about paying the border control agents.	Which they should have known ahead of time given that's exactly what happened when the Canadian trucker convoy blocked northern border crossings.	0
1	This has been at least a decade worth of planning. Plenty of us saw this coming.	Absolutely. We got here in slow motion, in broad daylight.	0
1	Aren’t we already in a cyber war with Russia?	It’s not a war.  Don’t call it that.  We are merely disarming Nazis	0
1	illegal immigration	The fact that it took 18 years and probably around $20k is the reason the US has an immigration problem, not the other way around.	0
1	Good. Everyone needs a tax hike if we are to pay back our debt without a stealth default.	No we don't. You could literally just raise the taxes on the top 5% of income earners to even where they were 30 years ago and you would not need to raise the taxes on those in poverty.	0
1	Someone has to be working	Hire more people then	0
1	I am not against *any* intervention. Obviously if Russia attacks the US or targets are service members, then it is game on, but until then, we are not the worlds police force. We need to focus on our own people and country first and foremost.	>we are not the worlds police force.  Yes we are.	0
1	I've been sort of active here. Do I need to apply for an approval?	Approval is only for posting, commenting is for everyone	0
1	Meanwhile there’s England not only dropping vax mandates but also mask mandates. Never thought “oi you got a loicence for that” England would be leading on this.	im SO done with mask mandates. today i got yelled at twice for not having a mask on and i wanted to laugh in their face so badly. this is getting SILLY	0
1	Yeah, can’t have those ~boys~ fighting age men seeking safety and asylum, they have to go get shot at and die instead!  Don’t those silly men know safety and living are womens roles? Man up! /s	Yeah  It's not like ISIS etc said they were putting their fighters into the refugee columns.   And its not like we've had real problems with Islamic grooming gangs in the UK	0
1	Yet I’ve seen people on here seriously arguing that doctors and lawyers should have their debt canceled too	I'm not making that argument and have no way of evaluating their arguments because I haven't seen them.	0
1	I’m from the USA. What about you?	The Netherlands. But asking strangers something is dangerous is the US?	0
1	I’m with you. I too live in a deep blue state and it’s nice to see the push become bigger and bigger.	Just for fun let's see if you can guess what state I live in. Clue: there is no way in hell your governor weighs more than my governor. Another clue: If corruption were an Olympic event my state would *easily* win the silver or gold.	0
1	happened already   refugee crisis 2015  the majority of refugees were men, the women stayed in the warzone	There was no decree that forced anyone to stay and fight, unlike what's happening in Ukraine.	0
1	Well there are sanctuary states for illegal immigrants why not for guns?	More sanctuary states like Missouri needed	0
1	Are there a lot of legal products you can buy in Western countries without taxation?	no, the us literally takes 25% of your fucking salary at least out of your paycheck	0
1	We already sent some but yes, they will arrive very quickly.	Yes that is what I say also. I’m bettin they have already have some and it got out so we had to own up to it and that’s fine. Oh send them javelin anti-tank middles that trump didn’t send. All because they would do him a favor.	0
1	The US leaving nato would have no effect on what is going on with Russia	The tides wouldn’t be affected if there were no moon.	0
1	This is one of the reasons why I regret making the first move in the past. Made it too easy and convenient. They’ll just take what they can get.	100% agree  If a man likes you, he’ll show it. No if’s or but’s. Women have got to stop giving men excuses and start seeing them for who they show themselves to be.	0
1	People who write these kinds of bills make me feel threatened….	You should listen to the REVEAL podcast episode about Texas abortion laws (iirc Jan 1st 2022 was when the ep came out).   Some of these republican lawyers and lobbyists really dont care and are being dicks for the sake of being dicks	0
1	Because they see us as a threat to their power.  Pure and simple.  They don’t want to share their toxic throne of manufactured victimhood. So they must demonise and attack anything they see as a potential threat.	And it looks like soon enough the whole world will become one big threat to them.	0
1	You mean those that receive more money from the government than anyone else?	Tell me you don't own anything without telling me you don't own anything.  Trust me... The gov't isn't giving me any money	0
1	Why wouldn’t foreigners be patriotic?	Why would they be?   Why would anyone be patriotic?	0
1	No, but he also hasn't invaded another country, and he hasn't run away.  There aren't two sides to that conflict.	That doesn't make him brave when he's the one who openly challenged Russia to do whatever they want to do about him joining NATO so they did.	0
1	It's when everything is for sale. Even our government.	If you want to use non-standard definitions, you should state that up front	0
1	Wow great point that I completely wasn’t thinking about. Was speaking of China specifically using forced labor and North Korea and a few other dictatorships.	How is US going to fix or do anything about slave labor in other countries if we can’t even get rid of it or lessen it in our home country?	0
1	It is, a very small country. It could also be done with political pressure.	Stop sending exports to the Vatican? Refuse to take their passports? What are they going to do?	0
1	Good.  These people have been getting thousands of dollars a month for up to a year and a half of free money.  Where the hell has it all been going?	If the D's get their way, infinity and forever.	0
1	Uh no. Millions of wage earning Americans have to spend hours doing it. Heck I (in US) spend hours gathering the papers to give to my accountant to do it costing me more money.  At its root Americans don’t like funding good government.	No they don't. All it requires is copying over a W2.	0
1	They also thank the housing crisis happened under him to. I’m pretty sure the banks failed in like 2006 or 2007 but hid the issue so their rich friends could plan their escape before the fallout.	I recall the housing crisis being under Bush also. The housing bubble burst, bringing down the economy.	0
1	I doubt they'd be allowed to.	Why wouldn't they be allowed.	0
1	If I pay a $500 due for my learned immunity, can I get my passport?	Get an antibody test and show as proof?	0
1	Oh, I know. Just trying to get them to read and think, instead of repeating the same propaganda they've been fed all of their life.	Meh, OP has been proven with evidence countless times how they are wrong, they just ignored it.	0
1	How about just sending them home?	I think high speed rail is the best solution. Tijuana to Toronto, nonstop. If the Canadians complain, just call them racist and keep rolling.	0
1	I am just going to point our that airlines are a business,  and their focus is on making money in whatever fashion they can (an easy way is cramming more people on a plane and charging for extra services).  That's the facts, Jack.	I'm not denying that. That doesn't change the fact that their business practices are predatory and out of touch with reality. Hell, it's still considered progressive for an airline to allow their flight attendants to wear *comfortable uniforms*.	0
1	Do what I did, begged my family for a loan.	Jesus Christ, men really do have to have an emergency fund to fight entitled women.	0
1	Those countries also pay absurd amounts of money in taxes.	Those countries' taxes are not as absurd as you think, especially considering that they are not paying for things like secondary education and medical treatment.	0
1	Assuming everything is about the US. You know there are 195 countries in the world right?	[looks like 50/50 ](https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/06/25/global-divide-on-homosexuality-persists/)	0
1	It’s been almost three generations.  When will you guys start invading Europe again?	We succeded on dominating europe in a peaceful war. So the next war would be againt non-europe powers.	0
1	Until now only US called them like that, so not a very satisfied answer.	AFAIK the US is the only country to announce the actual formation of a military branch for space. They were named Space Force.	0
1	Due to the pay cut OP may by eligible for unemployment if they quit	They'll struggle to remain unemployed long enough to even apply these days.	0
1	And how would that sign up work? Send a sign up to everyone, mail it back, wait weeks or months for them to be delivered? That's easy more cumbersome.	There's a guy in this thread talking about the UK experience of home delivery of tests.  Ordered it at 4pm one day, delivered the next day.	0
1	Guess we’re done then. Please don’t respond back,	> Please don’t respond back,  Why not?	0
1	They could just return the money??	So play the victim? You accepted money for sex and you'll give it back? Don't sell your body then	0
1	What are we supposed to get out of this	1 in 5 women need to stop voluntarily dropping out of school.	0
1	It’s like she’s doing everything she can, to claim there’s nothing to see here.	Like we were expecting anything else lol	0
1	No, they don’t.	really	0
1	Why are you making the reservations? Sorry to derail but I’m stuck on this.	Just some girlfriends and I are going, it was my activity suggestion so I took the lead	0
1	I don’t have to provide one.	That is the entire point of the cmv set up.	0
1	I don't disagree, but if forced, we risk them sabotaging what progress can be made in the Senate.	Surely if we keep wringing our hands, the Republicans will come to their senses.	0
1	The United States literally incarcerates more people per capita than any country in human history,  but sure go on believing that.	Yes thats what happens when you have a population prone to criminality and a state dedicated to bringing them to justice. People say it like its a bad thing. Would it realky be better if we just let the scum get away with crime every time?	0
1	That's how ruined our economy is right now...	You turkish?	0
1	Immigrants: let’s exploit the white mans kindness and guilt them into letting us live in their country where they will give us free stuff.  Also immigrants: the Democrats say white people are evil and I now hate this country!	To be fair, this is white men inviting immigrants to use as political weapon against the EU	1
1	Better idea: let’s just cancel any monetary debt we have to repay to China as restitution, call it even.	Steven Crowder was here.	0
1	I bet he didn’t see that coming!	Fuck off, you’re not funny	0
1	Did they?	If you go to the post there's a lock on the top right above the title. It means the post has been locked by the moderators.	0
1	More supply equals less demand. Who knew?	And lower labor costs.... which was the whole point of ushering women into the workforce.	0
1	The military is woke now. Be wary of their claims	The Pentagon is woke?   "everyone that i disagree with is woke".	0
1	If that's how you have to rationalize him acting in our interests, go for it.	Abbott is not our friend, my friend.	0
1	Where are you from?	Norway. My mom’s Norwegian and dad’s Colombian but I essentially regard myself as Norwegian.	0
1	Making more housing isn't working because most of the land in cities it's illegal to build more because of zoning laws. If we loosen restrictions on what type of housing can be built that would be a huge step forward in increasing the housing supply.	We aren’t running out of houses. The houses we have are too expensive. They’re too expensive because these firms fucked with the market.	0
1	Yes, it could. Sadly its brought more shit than good in the past 10-20 years.	Strongly disagree, it has brought stupidity in the last few years, at best.	0
1	Yeah because they’re suddenly going to reverse the collapse of the Russian economy.	Russia would rather partner with maga than the current regime path existing in China.	0
1	Because he wants to grift taxpayers that much more.	Hacks fly free	0
1	We can.	Yeah, I'm old enough to quit playing boxer the workhorse for pipedreams. I'm more at the "quit feeding the parasite and it will starve to death" stage.	0
1	Idiot. He is paying more in capital gains taxes this year, billions, than anyone in history.	I am sure he went against his tax advisors	0
1	How sad that European kids learned more about colonization than us Canadians.	I found in my ontario curriculum (graduated HS in 2005) we had a lot of coverage on native issues and residential schools	0
1	I don’t know the laws there but I’m sure it can’t do too much damage to report them unless you’re worried about your parents finding out	Do not guess at how much damage that can do in places you aren't familiar with. There are places where atheism can get you killed--many, in fact.	0
1	Doesn’t work in Europe	This news story didn’t take place in Europe.	0
1	What?   Removing their income or making them have a minimal income is a good way to fill congress with wealthy out of touch people (hmm that sounds familiar) lol	It would be x times min wage monthly.  Min wage monthly is around 1200 right now.  So make it 10x that.  So 125k.  They can live comfortably on that.	0
1	So what? Someone can work if they want to.	>So what?           So it wouldn't be an effective strike.                >Someone can work if they want to.                Not if the road is blocked they can't.	0
1	This has been at least a decade worth of planning. Plenty of us saw this coming.	5 decades, really.  RvW was a baffling decision for a long time, but the outcome was generally supported, even if the reasoning was suspect.	0
1	If someone makes money in your state and wants to move to another state so they can avoid taxes they can pay their taxes to leave. It would be a tax narrowly focused on the extreme minority of super rich people trying to leave a state to avoid taxation.	How do you prove they’re moving to avoid taxation? Sounds impossible	0
1	Well there are sanctuary states for illegal immigrants why not for guns?	No one is taking your guns you dufus. It’s been “threatened” for years. You will be all good with your assault rifles and yadda yadda. Nothing to get worked up about.	0
1	As if anyone needed more motivation to leave the cities.	or to stop voting democrat.	0
1	I forsee all shorts of bullshit shenanigans at the end of the year to manipulate stock prices to avoid paying those realized gains taxes and getting credits. I want fewer loopholes not more.	>I forsee all shorts of bullshit shenanigans at the end of the year to manipulate stock prices  That's very much illegal.	0
1	There is no point. We are born, eat , shit, fuck, pay taxes, then die	Such a bleak existence we have, then. I suppose there could be worse, though.	0
1	Why should they thrive on our hard times?	Because capitalism baybeeee	0
1	Sweet. I guess we’re all for letting immigrants come in 😀	I love it when people think improving immigration policy is a liberal commie thing.	1
1	Friends that live in Denmark tell me migrants don’t want to work or learn the language.They just waiting for the next handout.	Imagine quadrupling your standard of living, and having nothing expected from you in return? Can't even blame the migrants, I bet we'd all take that. America had a whole basket of lessons that Europe decided to ignore, presumably out of ego.	1
1	unironically yes, they have goals. they have standards. way better than the US in a lot of ways.	Tell me propaganda got you without saying lol have you even been to China lol	0
1	That was a different president.   However Russia still has the same leader that invaded Georgia and Ukraine.	And the current President was a Senator that bought into the lies that Iraq had WMDs and also helped in a 20 year illegal occupation of another country.	0
1	How about we prevent people from buying investment properties until the average family can afford a home again.	How about we prevent investment companies from buying houses people need to live in?	0
1	Because the U.S.	Right....so why would a vaccine be any different? Since when is it ever free	0
1	They have ~$16bn in cash.      Reckon that’s enough to be getting on with, especially for a friendly state that offers them a good deal given the employment and tourism they’d bring along with them.	What state is setup with the infrastructure to accept all of the disney traffic?  We're talking airports, hotels, highways, all that stuff.  Don't forget they have to have LOTS of reasonably priced land, and mild climate too.	0
1	We know names, they’ve been out for a while- nothing happened.	Bunch of handwaving and then a show trial to offload all blame on the blacksheep	0
1	Import citizens into a country that demonizes people seeking asylum on a daily basis? Maybe not bud.	But these would not be asylum seekers, they'd be workers	0
1	Sounds like a strange assumption to me. It is more likely that their education and travels to Europe led them to designing this great nation.	Who do you think was educating them?	0
1	&gt;Meanwhile liberals are trying to tax us to death  Whose us?  &gt;let in a flood of immigrants from countries that love national socialism.  source?  &gt;They want to take away the right to bear arms   Cool, no more shootings.	No more shootings, but more assaults of all forms, more robberies of all forms.	0
1	Veteran here.   It sucks, but a draft is necessary for a country to remain strong.  Also, please don't send women, they are terrible on deployments.	and this is why women aren’t drafted. People genuinely think all women aren’t capable of going to war but the average American male is. It’s misandrist and misogynistic in their own ways.	1
1	It's almost like the wars we fight and allies we have have nothing at all to do with being 'good' or moral, and everything to do with strategic value.	The invasion, destruction and “rebuilding” of Iraq had nothing to do with good or moral impulses, it was the work of a vindictive idiot dry drunk and his fascist accomplice.	0
1	my hypothesis is that they probably send money to help their family and end up with what is considered not enough money according to the Swedish government.	a good one, but we can never be so sure unless we get actual data, hmm.. i dont know if we can get it	0
1	This was a though one, until Russia started kidnapping thousands of civilians and shipping them thousands of miles to work in siberia.	Source?	0
1	Don’t bring your baggage to NC and ruin it.	Too late.	0
1	So he wants to force every American to take it but people coming into the country don't have to?	Same as they can just pour over the border and not get tested but as a legal citizen I need to test to fucking get back into my own country.	0
1	I’m in the US, like I said. What are you confused about? This is a normal phrase.	I am not confused.  I completely understand what you have said.  What I am saying is that it is an odd way to phrase it.  It's awkward and unnecessarily clunky.  But that's just my opinion.	0
1	They want more people to resort to off-the-books income, like drug dealing and sex trafficking. Why else would they defund police, release criminals, and import illegals?	>They want more people to resort to off-the-books income,  I'm down if they do shit like this	0
1	Help. I've made out most words but I still can't figure out what it means.	It is only with the heart that one can see rightly, what is essential is invisible to the eye.	0
1	Ah, you’re right.  That’s another possibility that makes sense.  But in that case, she’d need a ticket too.  Was she expecting OP to cover that also?	That’s how it reads to me!  Honestly, I suspect this woman wanted a free outing for herself and her family and thought she had scored and then lashed out when she was denied.	0
1	So this says that draft registration is pretty much still in place. What are you talking about?	It says the revisions still in place, I'm talking about the summoning to war part	0
1	That’s an odd stance for a bureaucracy, especially an EU member bureaucracy, to take, but my grasp of the German language is too poor to read and understand legalese beyond what is available in English.	It really is, I do hope things change for the better	0
1	The government wastes our money on a lot of things, this is not even close to the worst thing to waste money on lol	Not a good argument to disprove my point dude.	0
1	They should all be locked up. All of them	maybe not the brother ?	0
1	Ah I’m overseas so maybe that’s what I’m thinking of.	It's totally fine, they changed the regulations and restrictions a bunch of times so it's easy to mix them up.	0
1	I'm confused as to why this is even still being discussed.	Because they are trying to make people distrust the election system, so they can manipulate it in favor of themselves.	0
1	Sounds like we'll get to see it soon.	We probably won't see it today, don't get your hopes up lol. This trial is going to probably take 2 weeks.	0
1	Meanwhile, illegal immigrants with no papers can boat themselves into the state and get healthcare and public education.	I am all for this if someone has the balls to try to get to Hawaii from God knows where on a makeshift vessel. We're talking weeks at sea with piss poor equipment.	1
1	they'll invade, then you'll die instead	They don't even win against Vietnam farmer, lmao. And they want to win a war in the jungle of malay, sumatera and borneo? Lmao. Just by burning the forest in those 3 areas, all allies' weapon and airplane gonna be useless.	0
1	Maybe Russia wants some?	Only after they annex Ukraine	0
1	This. The people have been brainwashed	And then this.	0
1	They annexed a region that wanted to seceede but was not allowed to	Yes, otherwise known as invading a sovereign nation.	0
1	Our attention is not free!	SAY IT LOUDER FOR THE BROKIES IN THE BACK!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾	0
1	That the UN is a bunch of hypocrites ?	Thieves and liars.	0
1	Use less massive transports, what I mean is smaller units.	Smaller units like what? A car?	0
1	most people care about feeding their families and paying their bills.	So how does florida have some of the highest costs of living right now? Even with a republican government?	0
1	I've never been told this. Stop living in cities	Fair point.	0
1	By far the biggest bribe by a foreign government of a top US official.  Our our laws and Justice system porous enough to allow it?	What justice system?  It's corrupt like our politicians!	0
1	It tells you they value their country enough to risk their life for it. That's definitely something.	No it doesn't. Most people enlist for healthcare or schooling benefits or because they don't see any other options or come from a military family	0
1	NTA  He’s looking to abandon responsibilities, not be pampered. It’s very self centered and juvenile. I hope he comes to his senses.	Yea I’m also thinking he would not reciprocate in the slightest for op’s bday month, were she to go along w his requests. I’m sure he’d bring up her hesitation to comply as one of his reasons	0
1	Why are we still here?	Just to suffer?	0
1	Open borders were good enough for the founding fathers, but not for Texas?	You clearly know nothing about history.	0
1	Great, I think that anyone who lies about FDS in an attempt to argue that it should be banned like incel communities are part of a small fire that should be extinguished.	and i think the acceptance and overall encouragement of toxic sexism serves no good purpose in society and in fact does the opposite.  fuck FDS  AND every other sexist sub	0
1	It's seriously fucked up if your country sends two adults to prison for having consensual sex. Incest isn't even morally wrong, imo.	Damn if it isn’t morally wrong!  There’s something wrong with you if you think it isn’t.	0
1	The vows. One is right the other is wrong .	Could you explain? What do you mean one is right while the other is wrong?	0
1	Imagine the top porn searches by men being "gay male" and DILF.  Women are fucked up	Or not	0

1	In my case, it was the fact I got chlamydia from the second hook up I've ever experienced. I did use condom of course. Well, it didn't matter in the end. Then I never did it again, and I don't plan to change it. It's just too risky.	Literally, same. First casual encounter I had out of a 10 year relationship and I was naive, got a STI. I was ashamed of myself for being stupid, but really woke me up to how not worth it casual sex is.	0
1	Yes. I absolutely would and I think specifically because of the inclusive language in this bill a challenge to such a movie is likely to be successful.	I don't believe there has ever been a comparable legal case in any country at any point in history. I feel like you just don't have a very good sense of how the world works if that seems plausible to you.	0

1	I must be an incel bc I was right about him marrying the first person he slept with?  Wow.  What does that make you, then?	Homie you need to fuck off LOL	0
1	Going down the wrong path? What path? Why is it wrong?  Some people identify with a gender that doesn't align with their biological sex. That's it.	Treating a neurological condition using cosmetic surgery? It’s very 19th century. It is literally the only condition where this isn’t seen as barbaric.	0
1	Just throwing this out there. You’re a married man with some connections to the military and St. Louis, Missouri.	So you’ve narrowed me down to one of 680,000 men in the area	0

1	Incorporating other people. Want to have a threesome. Doesn't matter if male or female. Everything's fine by me. Never had the occasion and never wanted to actively search for one in dating apps or so.	I see, nice. Also that’s a fair point. Lol	0
1	Clam bake	A clam jam	0
1	No, it's like being gay or lesbian or straight, people are naturally attracted to different things or not at all, such is the case with ace and/or aro (they're two different things but normally go hand in hand)	That confused me even more lol. At the end of the day you are either attracted to a male or female? Sorry if that comes off weird, I’m just struggling to understand	0
1	then don't have sex	That's the idea.	0
1	Privilege doesn’t exist, you earn respect and respect others	Privilege is everywhere.	0
1	FDS is filled with highly depressed women and lesbians trying to convince vulnerable straight women to become lesbian.  Predatory at best.	Not as predatory as incels hitting on women at least.	1
1	All the time, I def got the better deal in this marriage.	It's important to celebrate the awesome women out there. They are so few and far between	0
1	For you married couples out there, it sounds like it would likely be $125k for an individual, or $250k for married couples filing jointly.  So double income couples shouldn't worry about that $125k figure.	Exactly why I came to the comments, thank you!	0
1	What would change your view? Would stats that show a considerable portion of couples who have gotten married remain married?	Perhaps, but they might have stayed married because of social pressure, finances, Status etc.	0
1	No actually I despise hook up culture and prefer a genuine  relationship I never persuade a girl just for a hook up in my life	But you only care about having a girl to have sex with. You see no point to interacting with women as human beings	0
1	Getting bullied and made fun of and being told to man up because of your gender.	Find new friends	0
1	Ur not a man how can u say what a man is ???	Doesn't matter what I am, I do know 100% for sure, if she's pregnant she's a woman.	0
1	How does anyone get married?	probs introduce as friends and when it's serious, introduce bf/gf as someone they started having feelings for	0
1	They are not transphobic. They are gynocentric.  They always were.     The gender-neutral draft bill and this support for TERFs just demonstrated this to the world.	It has nothing to do with being gynocentric and everything to do with forcing men and women into traditional gender roles.	1
1	There's a difference between something made as an actual thing and something made by a group of people that wanted to watch both transphobes and transgender people get pissed off because of a fake thing they made up	Except all the other stuff is just made up too, and not not actual things.	0
1	For you married couples out there, it sounds like it would likely be $125k for an individual, or $250k for married couples filing jointly.  So double income couples shouldn't worry about that $125k figure.	Thank you 🙏🏽	0
1	I would have chosen my dad and his new wife over my n-mom and her rotation of (some actually diagnosed) psychotic women partners. Not all lesbians are the same, and some really hate children but choose single moms anyway.	One example doesn’t disprove the rule, it has been studied scientifically.  Furthermore I said lesbian couples.  Your mother with a list of partners wouldn’t be considered that.	1
1	That u/CameForMyAss only has 19 hours to live :(	How is that depressing?	0
1	I reckon it’s just that society let’s girls be more comfortable exploring their sexuality than men, cause if a dude was like he watches guys masturbate he would probably be called gay.	Probably because that’s pretty gay?	0
1	Abortion should always be legal, don’t force your religious beliefs onto others.	Stop acting like religion is the only reason why people disagree with abortion	1
1	Yes, in fact I looked up that homosexual male relationships are more likely to last long   Hmmm wonder why?	If it upsets you so much date a man then	0
1	FDS is against casual sex though.	Yikes	0
1	He's regretting focusing on CRT instead of child porn.	Nah the talking point scoring the most on /r/conservative is about whether can she define a woman.	0
1	Yeah it can be fun when you're a very young man but as you mature you see how creepy and manipulative it is. An attempt to force intimacy and inject sexuality into a situation where it isn't wanted or asked for.	This is actually how my first gf got me to smash, i was waiting for marraige at the time .-.	0
1	OP commented that they are not supportive of his cousin and of OPs sexual identity. That got me thinking about the mom finding ways to punish OP. Whatever the reason is, the mom is the true asshole here.	That makes sense, either yeah, her mother is the asshole here.	0
1	Acting might be the easiest job in the entire world. Fuck every single one of these douches.	Exactly and most of the ones who chime in to shit like this aren't even relevant so they trying to use these kind of situations to get attention.	0

1	I’m all for love , if she your woman or family it’s different  But what about some person you don’t care about and feels like they can just physically slap you	Love is good. But what really surprises me is how you got from pokemons to love in just one day? 🤔	0
1	Actually after all that brother iv been advised that what im talking about is called intersex not trans!   I better understand the difference.	Ya I know	0
1	I hate how he uses the plural We.	Its a cornball sales trick, try to tie their interests together.	0
1	So, if Maddie had gotten pregnant, OP should get a say in things?	Ethically, yes. Assuming she wanted to be involved. But as other people have mentioned, these were conversations that needed to happen prior to intercourse.	0
1	There are other ways to detect them, without making a whole gender suffer.	This doesn’t make a whole gender suffer, and it doesn’t impact any one gender more than the other. Did you read the ad?	0
1	I thought Alex Jones was the guy who said chem trails make frogs gay?	I have a feeling you are all talking about the same Alex Jones…	0
1	Also the LVM will bad mouth you for being controlling.	I guess LVM will likely badmouth you anyway, so why even bother🤷🏼‍♀️	0
1	To realize children are more vulnerable than grown men? Idiot	You’re replying to so many comments and each one downvoted to hell, and -100 comment karma already? Imagine your opinions being that garbage, moron.	0
1	I gave them a chance at having a healthy relationship with me. When they made it clear that that wasn't possible, they terminated whatever right they had to any relationship with me.	Lol that's what disowning is. You made that decision, not them. There is no "right" here for you to unilaterally determine they lost.	0
1	Gosh, what happens to all of the miscarriages?  How do we determine what was intentional versus bad luck?  Where do unviable or eptopic pregnancies fall in this?  Do we just kill them all and let "God" sort it out?	Don’t get them further down that road. They already jail women for miscarriages. Especially non white ones.	0

1	you just sound like a germaphobe and I’m surprised you can go anywhere in public without freaking out lol	I think i am one, but just try to power through. I don’t mind cleaning other people’s messes, but when i shower or eat or live, I want it to be clean. Not sterile, just no hairs or crumbs.	0
1	Steak and Blowjob Day is just a regular Tuesday for my relationship! Not sure why some men settle.	Only Tuesdays?	0
1	Yes, but a 60 year old guy likely doesn’t have much in common with a 20 year old, so the majority of time they are only dating them because of the physical attraction and the objectification.	An average guy most likely doesn't have much in common with an average girl, regardless of their age. That's why people usually match on the basis on their individual personality.	0
1	In what world does 2 people "raping" each other at the same time make sense???	It makes sense because its what the definition is. No it doesn't make logical sense, but its how we make judgements in court.	0
1	Being transgender isn't sexually transmissible	That's not the point, it's keeping a secret of something that needs to be disclosed.	0
1	See, that’s what’s not fair in our society. Strippers can’t give advice without a law license, but lawyers will screw you without a sex license.	The legal solution is obvious: get a stripper who is also a certified lawyer.	0
1	Happy belated new years! I admire your mindset. I’m married but my independence and individuality is important to me. After reading your post, I wrote out a list of goals for myself this year. Thanks for the inspiration!! 🥳	You’re welcome - here’s to leveling up this year 🥂	0
1	Prostitution should be free too.	Actually you can hook up with people for free. 0-0	0
1	Awe. Thank you. I am happily married to a man who is so worried about triggering me that he (tmi) has gotten off of me mid orgasm because he heard my breathing change and he thought i might be having an attack.	That is the respect that is due you. I'm so happy you have such a respectful and aware partner	0
1	“…to have sexual relations with over 60 children”  I have sexual relations with my wife.  This guy raped (allegedly) dozens of children.	My thoughts exactly.  You don't have sexual relations with children.  You rape them.  Call it what it is.    People are hesitant to call crimes by their names any more when a minority is involved.	0
1	The problem is the entire 30% who do will vote and half or more of the don'ts will sit at home on election day and then complain.	Tbf I can’t imagine anything would drive up Democratic turn out more than Trump running. I don’t want to see him run but if it happens it will probably ensure a GOP loss. Assuming of course they don’t pull  off a successful coup this time around.	0
1	If he’s been with his “affair partner” and second family for 13 years, then that means he started cheating on his wife with her when SHE WAS 19 AND HE WAS 35 🤮	He started cheating on her long before her 'emotional affair' but hey... Double standards	0
1	The fact that my principal got fired for being Gay, and our superintendent pushing a coffin	Hopefully those things are not related	0
1	A wedding is also not an emergency that requires him to attend...	Maybe not but it is a commitment that should not be broken lightly.	0
1	Perverts will always try to "convert" and contaminate everything they know. That's what gets them off; bringing people to hell with them.  I'm a Christian man and they do it with us also, thinking that we are equally dominated by our sins.	Man the amount of jokes and fetishes on Catholic nuns and girls school and priests etc breaks my heart. I have sympathy for you guys.	0
1	I've been participating in r/MensRights for years and haven't received any ban notices. I don't care enough to go to other subs to see if I'm banned or not. But if I do get a ban notice I'm printing it off and framing it	I got a ban even from them even some of those mods are shit	0
1	But don't both go hand in hand?	Not really, POC have have almost the same rights as white people, at least in USA/UK. But as you have pointed out, they are treated differently.	0
1	TERF is Trans-Exclusionary Radical Feminist. The sole thing that differentiates them from a radical feminist is that they exclude trans women from their feminism.   You might have more in common with TERFs than you think.	Oh then I guess rad fems are the problem, not just terfs	0
1	or... trying to date	They’re not. It’s a pure ego booster.	0
1	Okay and what do you mean by that? Yeah some people are weird but being gay is different from wanting to fuck a fucking goat or marry a child	Not really. The man who loves his goat will tell you.	0
1	It is a red flag. If she is as great as she has led my son to believe why isn’t she already married? She said that she didn’t want to date while she was in college and building a career but I think that is a bunch of bologna.	Big boomer energy, YTA.	0
1	I treat people regardless of their gender, and I believe that its the way people should be treated.  So it shouldnt matter whether we should treat them like girls or not, cause we shouldnt treat people differently cause of their gender	Thank you! Completely agree!	0
1	I love a good LVM with no filter (so long as I am not dating him.) 😂 Please keep posting more of these. They give me life!	Same!! Another thread just reminded me of another thing he said so I'll have to update this post	0
1	It's the thought that counts. The ring is just a symbol, or token, and can be any type with or without a stone. Some couples only wear bands, and ditch gemstones altogether.	I saw a couple the other day with bent paper clips or wires or something and I was frankly very confused	0
1	Sometimes getting pregnant just happens without any known effort or attempt to make a baby...	That is also not part of the discussion. Sorry I should've included that.	0
1	Trans women are women, no matter how ignorant or awful some are.	That's a faith-based belief.	0
1	I feel you. I was 15 when I fell in love for the first time. Now, 13 years and 4 relationships later, I’m still at square one. Dating/finding the right one is so emotionally taxing. The scary part is there’s no guarantee I will succeed. Sigh.	Well we *are* redditors	0
1	Don’t get married folks	The marriage is not the problem here. Being a total pushover with no boundaries is the problem.   People will treat you as well or bad as you require them to. This dude has let her walk all over him for quite a while now.	0
1	Refer to someone as a child who pays bills, rent, owns a car, amongst other things and you’ll find your comment dumb. Teenagers is a spectrum of age and there’s the younger years and the adult years. Some don’t mature early but a lot do.	Yeah you can tell yourself that all you want.  The most mature teenager still has next to no real life experience. IMO anyone under about 25 is a child.	0
1	My favorite is when a guy complains about being put through the wringer in divorce court, and he gets called an incel.  Like...what do they think he was doing with his wife before they split up?	They don’t use logic	0
1	Self respect.  Young boys today will simp over anyone with a vagina and a pulse.	I'd like to point out that vagina is optional too if you're into fem-passing femboys. /s	0
1	I read it as this has nothing to do with the affair. As there was an affair??	Nothing to do with the fact that I cheated on your mom with this(then) 24 year old person. Then the divorce. Then the passing of ex-wife. That’s how I read it.	0
1	God invented God .... 4 d chess.  My God is lesbian.	My god always needs money!	0
1	There's a difference between something made as an actual thing and something made by a group of people that wanted to watch both transphobes and transgender people get pissed off because of a fake thing they made up	I don’t think so really. In the end, they’re both made up - and have as much validity as anything else that’s not real: none.	0
1	Implications are strong	Assumptions even stronger.	0
1	Also, fk gender roles.I'm not gonna be anyone's workhorse and I don't have a duty towards anyone unless I choose to.  There is nothing more valuable than freedom.	>fk gender roles.  why are you even in this sub then? slow claps to your commitment to die alone in misery.	0
1	Gay men literally do not have to worry ab women’s reproductive rights. You’re the homophobe if you are offended by that statement	\#justBPDthings	0
1	Nah, I'll get pregnant immediately.	U not a girl	0
1	What do you mean by "direct relationship"?	We’re not cousins uncles/aunts , niece/nephew etc. if I met you down the road you would be a stranger. We have no direct relationship in that regard	0
1	Ah, yes, the third act breakup. About as annoying as the forced romance.	There are a lot of annoying romance tropes. Especially will they won’t they romances. It was the one thing I didn’t like about Scrubs.	0
1	Remind her that "Jesus" never openly condemned homosexuality in any way.	Meh, Jesus is god to most Christians, god-Jesus absolutely said to kill gay people in the OT. The real question is the mental backflips to excuse the awful guidance in the OT.	0
1	The average redditor is a young male. I would expect nothing less than casual, or even overt, sexism.	I mean, if they were 12, maybe. But 20? 25? There’s no way they’re not old enough to know better. Women that age have already learned how the world works.	0
1	That's why I don't like to marry	Exactly  And that’s why I have a camera in plain view big as day in my studio apartment that pretty much record everywhere at once and even sound . I’ll be dammed if that sexual assault bullishit these evil little shits like to play nowadays.	0
1	The other thing is 1/6 pregnancies end in miscarriage so you have a ~17% chance of it not even making it to term.	considering our visit to the doc the other day confirmed a perfectly healthy and good looking pregnancy the chance of her having the baby is 83% I have to assume this is happening.	0
1	Also, as for your pay for sex part. I am fucking 18. So stop spreading bad rumors and go learn how to respect people you creep	Please respect woman you incel… since I’m a creep might as well call things the way I see them. I love how you stfu about that India issue real fast, I hope mods read this too.	0
1	Dear Prudence. My husband physically assaulted me in a way some of my friends and family found amusing. Divorce?  ...no shit. Divorce. Also they're not your friends and you need new family.	She literally said the one thing she didn't want was her face smashed in cake. Also, who TF does this? Is it a tradition in some cultures? Seems like a shitty thing to do to a bride on her wedding day, given the hair and makeup effort.	0
1	IS there a gender that can actually read all that at that speed because I sure couldn't. Genius level iq by the way, I rarely think its relevant to include that but yea I couldn't come close to catching what the point of all that was.	Pretty easy to glimpse over  lol	0
1	My nephew was born at 24 weeks. He is now 5 years old, fully functional and healthy. And there are some born even earlier who survived and function as humans.   Abortion doctors know what they're doing.	I was born 3 months early back in 92, 2lbs 2oz, no issues at all.	0
1	Marriages are shared. Decisions are decided together. If she wants IVF and he doesn't, they come to an agreement together. The point is not to wait too long before seeking treatment if that's what you end up wanting.	>Marriages are shared.  LOL - no they not  there's a reason for the phrase " what mine is mine and what yours is also mine "	0
1	I masturbate to porn	Is porn not a person (or at least the models)?	0
1	I had a buddy in the military named Gaylord. I’m pretty openly gay, so when my friends introduced me to Gaylord as a joke, I picked up the nearest pickaxe and said “he’s no lord of mine” and everyone laughed	Thats what my Gaylord did in a way, he was straight but would do "Gay" jokes on us like if i bend over i would hear scurrying basicly he would try to hump us when we did but then we got him when he bent over....all i miss the good days	0
1	I was wondering is PIV real in real life? I’m a virgin so that’s why I’m asking	What's a virgin?	0
1	Was your mother married to your father while being pregnant with you? Like they weren't married..she got pregnant and then got married and then she had you?	No they never go married	0
1	Maybe you’re watching too much porn.	Infact it's the opposite. Until few months ago I most used to shake just once a day but since a month or so, I've decreased the frequency to twice a week, no more than that. Is that excessive?	0
1	You've got your nomenclature all bungled.  If a cis man transitions, that's a trans woman.    A trans man is a afab who now presents as male.	They said nothing wrong. Trans men take testosterone, and would give them a large advantage against cis women.	0
1	Why are we enabling this trans delusion?	Do tell us, if it is a 'delusion,' how should it be treated?	1
1	She can’t reschedule her birthday. She *could* reschedule the party but she shouldn’t have to. If he misses it, that’s on him, but she’s not an AH for throwing her party on her actual birthday. Not in the slightest.	And he shouldn't have to miss a literal once in a lifetime event over something that happens annually and when it's common to celebrate not on the actual day. And I never said she was an asshole.	0
1	Oh, well… i am doing what i said so wanted to share it.  Why is she pressing on cohabitation after 1 y? Is she in her 30’s with no kids or what?	Because......as I've said twice.....I'm moving 2000 miles away.	0
1	Incorrect.  IT's actually a HUGE pain for anyone who transitions to male over the age of 27, as they're now a man who has NOT registered for selective service, and MOST systems are not equipped to handle that.	It's 26.  You have up until your 26th birthday.	0
1	LoL that r/nothowgirlswork they slammed my comment karma.  They're terrible.	idk if its just me but sometimes on that sub i having a feeling yeah that exactly how women works hope i am nor alone on that one	0
1	Damn democrats still upset they can’t hace sexualized conversations with 5-9 year olds.	Why do you equate education with sexualization? Why do you equate ignorance with purity? Why is Matt Gaetz allowed to remain in the Republican party if they are so interested in protecting children?	0
1	Yep. Check out Sandman and Better Bachelor on youtube, they have some interesting videos about what might happen in the near(ish) future with regard to dating and gender relations.	I'm a BB watcher myself, but I haven't kept up much with what Joker's posted in the last...few? Several? months. In which of his vids in that time span did he talk about that?	0
1	I think she miscarried the twins one right after the other, twins don't always miscarry together	Ooh I missed that part, thanks	0

1	Life begins at conception	It fine if you believe that even though the bible doesn't say it.   As long as you don't use the government to force your personal opinion on women.	1
1	Since they are a F/F couple I'm guessing OP used the sperm from her wife's brother. That way they are biologically related to both parents.	Yes. This exactly.	0
1	Again. Random ass person. I dont care what someones opinion on gender is. Trans people would not exist if gender was not real, this is a ridiculously transphobic statement. Gender roles are the issue, gender itself is not	They’re are literally an expert on gender. Social constructs don’t mean that they don’t exist, or that it’s changeable.	0
1	It’s like they don’t take in to account that most the people accused of Pedophilia are heterosexuals.	And those that are in office that are pedophiles are overwhelmingly Republican.	0
1	A good way to start a discussion isn’t by bashing the people you’re asking the question to.	Common sense 101	0
1	I'm familiar with the first half, but I was never called frigid. They just decided I must be a lesbian.	That was a weird one, they started calling me a lesbian before I even know what it meant. Nah, I'm just autistic and didn't feel comfortable talking to the boys in my class because at that point I really couldn't understand them at all	0
1	I hate how he uses the plural We.	The royal "we"	0
1	Just some girlfriends and I are going, it was my activity suggestion so I took the lead	That sounds like an awesome girls night!	0
1	I don’t think I’ve ever heard of anyone staying married so they can brag about being married for so long.	Exactly	0
1	This will be the left in 20 years. If you or your child says no to their sexual advances - it will be considered racism, bigotry and a hate crime.	*we just find it problematic that you are saying no to a trans person.*	0
1	Great points. PLUS, not all HVMs will be compatible with you. Just bc he's HVM doesn't necessarily mean you two are compatible.	Yeah. People you're compatible with as life partners are a true minority.	0
1	I did, it just took a while. Teenagers are dumb by nature and I was once a teenager.	i was a teenager too and a lesbian yet i never had this issue. its not a teenager issue, its a male entitlement issue	0
1	Wanted to kill someone who holds different beliefs and values then you sounds a little bigoted and xenophobic.	I understand that, but they were doing it first. The entire party is founded on such things!	0
1	What do u think?	i think Saturdays are better, you can lay in bed all day listening to quran.	0
1	If you’re scared of men pretending to be women in women’s bathrooms, you’re not scared of trans women but cis men.	Isn't this *exactly* the point?  How does one distinguish between the two?  It's never been about discriminating against trans people intentionally, it's just a mistrust of males because of the much higher rates at which males commit sex crimes.	0
1	Iconic queer films	Apart from Priscilla, what are the other ones?	0
1	Your math in your previous comments uses the rate of fatal pregnancies with unaborted pregnancies as the same as the rate of fatal pregnancies in aborted pregnancies.  I'm asking you to justify the variables you've used in your own math.	Ok i see what you mean. Your right, but the numbers im sure are not VASTLY different. There rewlly isnt a way to know tbh	0
1	Why do dudes who’ve never fucked a woman or will even get the chance to have sex have such strong opinions on abortion? Lmao	I don’t know why do you have such strong opinions on abortions	1
1	Thats not what the post was saying though. There is a difference between agreeing to a monogamous relationship and that trust being broken, and not letting your partner do things.	What’s the difference? Cause to me a relationship is mono until both parties decide otherwise. (I would’ve talked about this obviously, cause i would just see her as a friend i can fuck otherwise lol)	0
1	Had a drunk cougar grab my crotch one night in a bar. Got told to laugh it off, she didn't mean any harm.  Just hazarding a guess that if the genders were reversed, it would have been taken more seriously.	Dont even get me started on dirty old ladies.	0
1	Are you sure you guys are exclusive? Did you have the talk? Because this sounds like you haven’t talked about boundaries and have actually committed to a relationship.	I mean we never actually sat down and had a talk but from things we both said yes we both believe that we are exclusive. She said she would never sleep with someone else. We just have different views on intimacy I suppose.	0
1	Tom Lykis was the first I ever heard recommend putting hot sauce in condoms before you throw them away.  Glad to see it still works to smoke out the users.	facts lol	0
1	Such as teaching kids the idea that gender is malleable. Idk if that’s “biologically inaccurate” but it certainly is an ideological choice.	Ideological choice is note what I had asked, they made claims I’m assuming on something they believe and they made broad claims that need some clarity	0

1	fuck yea! i’m a gay dude, if i see a crowd of 20 something year olds running at me i’m rock hard and in heaven bro	>a crowd of 20 something year olds running at me  Why would we run at you ? That doesnt make sense	0

1	&gt;“Because if you can’t get through the day at work without watching porn, then you have got an issue."  She's right.	Because if you can't get through the day without gossiping with a coworker over the latest inconsequential event (or workplace hunk) or batting your eyelashes at said hunk, then you have got an issue.	0
1	One of my college roommates would physically recoil if she heard the word. I blame it on her strict catholic upbringing. She had an uncomfortable relationship with her own sexuality.	That sounds awful.	0
1	Anonymous charitable giving is close to just winning $5 million, but since I didn't put forward the caveat in the original CMV so you get a !delta	Confirmed: 1 delta awarded to /u/xmuskorx ([50∆](/r/changemyview/wiki/user/xmuskorx)).  ^[Delta System Explained](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltasystem) ^| ^[Deltaboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/changemyview/wiki/deltaboards)	0

1	Well it wouldn't be my problem. I'm not getting married. Especially to a female like that. The simps can have her.	Wisdom.	0
1	Then why would any man arrange "a cold,manifactured nuclear family with no love" for himself?	men back then wanted a slave, not a partner, r/facepalm	0
1	But muh body Libs gonna loose their minds again	they get to control their body AND your body.	0
1	YTA, and I'm sorry he didn't realize this before he got you pregnant.	Came here to say the same thing, bf is going to regret having shot that load (not the baby itself, but having a baby with OP). YTA massively	0
1	I have a perfect man.  In my past i had piece of shit men for boyfriends/husband. It is the man not the entire gender.	Then why the hell are you calling THE ENTIRE HUMAN SPECIES a piece of shit and blight to the world?	0
1	Adults in a healthy relationship is fine but children need room to grow.	Agreed. It's not healthy for children, or for that matter their parents, for their parents to demand to know everything the child does.	0
1	Depending on why/how your relationship ended, they may have done it because it hurts to see you. Out of sight out of mind.	Because I called him out for the negativity and toxicity he always has, took it real personal too because of me telling the harsh truth and blocked me.	0
1	Obviously not in the literal sense, that's not possible, avoid marriage, short term relationships, don't cohabitate, don't raise another man's children.	I'm an introvert I just avoid everyone	0
1	Or just that teenagers are notoriously challenging to a parent's new partner and she didn't want to put up with it.  This would not be as much of an issue if you rarely saw your child, but full time custody was enough to scare her off.	Go and tell this to the feminists who shame men for not dating single mothers..       People have their reasons.     Its just that society thinks ok to shame men for their choices, but start justifying when women make those same choices...	0
1	Proving me wrong? Lol are you nuts? What claim did u make that you proved wrong? You're just missing the point of OP.	your accused her of being sexist for wanting to protect herself, i don't see why i miss the point here	0
1	no u	you should go to a school where they teach people how to not	0
1	Underneath OPs transphobia, I'm pretty sure they're actually trans and deeply closeted.	😂 There’s not such thing as a “closeted trans.” I don’t have any feeling of gender dysphoria, like I once did.	0
1	Censorship is bad period. Vile or not content should be labelled and filter on a personal level and not by any government or other organisations. If you have censorship  you do not have free speech.	Hard disagree. Scroll r/AgainstDegenerateSubs for 5 minutes, and tell me if you still believe that nothing online should be censored.	0
1	OMG stay home then. Masks don’t work, be a Fuckin man	No good. Forget a mask (because you're right, for the most part, they are a joke), but the guy was not even covering his cough. And you've got to realize people can't afford to stay home.	0
1	Your "sisterhood" is not supporting you. They want you to be as miserable as they are.	Gavin McInnes compares them to the Warbler bird, which sabotages the nests of other Warblers. I quite like the metaphor	0
1	jail is not punishment when you are married to a creature like nancy pelosi	It actually reminds me of Arrested Development.	0
1	Husband does this ALL. THE. TIME.    The funny thing is he does this to impress me.  He wants to wow me with a little nugget of information that he has, but doesn't remember where he got it.	Aww, that's kind of adorable. [Source amnesia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_amnesia) is a thing, it's hard to keep track of but I'm pretty sure I do it a lot too.	0
1	Well the husband is the legal father too.  So why do they get to sue?  They wanted a baby.  They got one.  If biological is important and actionable hear, why shouldn't it be why a man's wife cheats?	Because they had a contract with the fertility clinic that didn’t get fulfilled. The fertility clinic violated standards and malpracticed.	0
1	They consummated the marriage at that time yes. You should learn what the fallacy of presentism is.	I’m sorry I don’t understand?	0
1	So boys should not know what it feels like. Got you.	I don't want any child to experience deliberate pain, especially not  to satisfy your disgusting revenge fantasy.	0
1	Might explain why a good amount of IT users are asexual.	Being asexual doesn't cause sticky keyboards... Someone is lying 😂	0
1	We can also add that female bisexuality is seen as a nice fetish by many men, while male bisexuality is seen as gross by most women.	Unless the woman is bi , which I've never understand why women who aren't bi see bisexual men as gay . Bi men need more respect	0
1	Lol don’t get me wrong. I would have no problem getting down with a 24 year old, but I just don’t think an actual relationship would be possible. All that being said, anything is possible.	Aaaand ya made it weird. You should feel just as uneasy at the thought of having sex with someone young enough to be your daughter.	0
1	Not liking condoms is not a boundary. Not having sex with someone who won’t use a condom is a boundary.	Well, in my opinion, having a functioning vasectomy and a clean STD profile can help very much	0
1	Do you think minstrel shows were a good thing that we should still be doing?	That's not cultural appreciation. That's called racism	0
1	Again, nobody goes to a club solely for dancing, when I see an asexual that goes to a club, I'll ask them for you, okay?	AGAIN, you don’t know everyone…  You make this claim, it is not remotely based in reality.   You said they only go for sexual/romantic attention. Drugs, dancing, and hanging with friends are all great reasons to go to a club.   Stop posting bullshit	1
1	I’ve never been with a girl that has meat curtains, so porn vaginas look pretty real to me.	Oh you're missing out!	0
1	To me it's the reddit equivalent of someone on YouTube commenting "FIRST!"  Stop it.	“Stop it” spoken out to an unnamed group is one of mine lol.  Funny how we all have quirks that grate on nerves.	0
1	FUCK YEAH! snack for later!	Eye eggs is tastiest eggs	0
1	I have *so many* stories about that dude, it's ridiculous. I basically learned all the FDS rules from watching my mom end up in terrible relationships.	You sound mentally strong and emotionally mature, even when you were much younger.	0
1	But trans women are not born female... so no... that would be factually wrong. Now if you call a trans man a female, then yea you would be right. Possibly insensitive, but scientifically right.	I never said I would call trans women a female	0
1	Reddit is 90% boys between 12-18, I'm willing to bet	This sub and /r/pics and /r/funny maybe. But most of the people I interact with seem to be 30 plus.	0
1	Depending on where you live, they can! Toplessless for both genders is legal at the state level in over two-thirds of U.S. states as well as most of Europe, South America, Canada, Australia, and certain areas in Asia along the Pacific.	The stigma is still there though. Law isn't the only thing stopping people from doing things.	0
1	Does your boyfriend bother to be sexually appealing at all times or nah?	I’m positive he doesn’t.	0
1	I just feel embarrassed for the kind of porn I watched lmao	Spill it	0
1	&gt;I remember watching a documentary she presented on sex workers and she just looked like a total fool who had no idea what she was talking about  Sure but not everyone has your extensive experience of sex workers 😁	Tbf he sure has seen a lot of sex workers, but only for about three minutes each time.	0
1	Raging heterosexuals do not type things like "OH MY GAWWWW."	You win. Clearly you are almost very much like Saint Shelley of the Red Hair.	0
1	A consenting couple that aren’t related by blood or marriage. Preferably, a married one	Sounds like a big moneymaker....	0
1	99 movies about straigth people, sleep.  1 movie with a gay character:  &gt;If trans people would make less a fuss about their sexuality, I'd say others wouldn't care either.	You can say the same about Muslim characters	0
1	I’ll start this time…  Abortion is bad because it kills someone. People should be responsible for their actions snd the situations they put themselves in  Before you downvote, remember what sub your on! 😁	Also, promoting killing people is against reddit policy and you can and will be warned, and have your account banned.	0
1	Exclusivity is essential for that type of relationship. In *every* case, not just mine. Sex workers can only be in relationships with ppl who just want sex and nothing else.	I have no experience here, but I still disagree. it may be extremely rare but I think it possible.  I just don't think it's fair for you to say "EVERY time"	0
1	YTA. If you can't relate to movies about people from other cultures, gay people, and other groups that means you're more homophobic, racist, xenophobic, etc. than you think. Either work on it or keep that shit to yourself.	Would you prefer reading a book on Mathematical proofs of singularities in space time over a novel? If not, are you a non believer in science?	0
1	Yeah separate stories just an example of poor decision making. The sex was in a church basement. (Don't worry, not with a priest.)	Ok, I have a few questions and if you don't wanna answer i fully understand	0
1	Get an IUD. You can take it out as soon as you're ready for babies but once it's in you don't need to do anything. He can't tamper with that be	Or, abstane from sex with him until he grows up.	0
1	And you would marry, and share that million dollars?	Nah, just fuck.   Lmao kidding. I won't pay a million dollars for anything that's not necessary. Even if I had billions.	0
1	Ah,that sub is just a clone of FDS.  I sometimes laugh at their general stupidity.  sometimes though,i feel sad that we consider these as human beings.	LMAOO	0
1	When you use a prenup, you are overriding the default rules, so you restate the ones you want to keep in effect.  Belt and suspenders.	So this prenup only exists to state their incomes would remain separate until a child is birthed, instead of when they marry (which I assume would be the default)? This makes her look worse to me.	0
1	NTA - it’s your MOH. You get to pick it. Don’t marry someone who doesn’t support you in this	My fiance just told his dad at Thanksgiving he needs a social media break.  FIL has been getting so angry about posts on Instagram recently.	0
1	Why the fuck are you here? If you believe that speech is sexual harassment then you have no reason to be here.	I'm not allowed to comment on men's rights if I think speech can be sexual harassment?    What exactly do you think sexual harassment is?	0
1	What I find kinda funny is this guy's definition of "toxic towards men". We don't bow to men, and protect ourselves, so we're toxic?  Although I have to wonder - if she has already determined he's not HV, why is she still dating him 7 months later???	That was the biggest giveaway that this is fake. No one that *actually* subscribes here would do that. Literally the only message he's trying to get across is that boo, *fds kweens are meeenies!*	0

1	I live in texas, and I've never been in a place where the people are proud of the things that make texas a shithole of racism, homophobia, misogyny,and xenophobia.	Have you been to Amarillo?  That's where my dad's side of the family is from, and I wish I could say my experience matched yours	0
1	Religion has nothing to do with it same sex marriage IS wrong.	How did a gay couple getting married hurt you?	1
1	I didn't say anything about it being a suggestion. But it's not even a *consideration* for this type of relationship at this time.  Not unless they would like to divorce.	Sure. To you.	0
1	For first dates, always, *always* do something free or low cost. Dates are about getting to know the person. Coffee, go for a bike ride or walk, that sorta thing.	Second this, not spending a dime on some stranger. Besides, restaurant dates can feel so awkward. Like, you’re just stuck there. If you’re going for a walk you can always just run a way, and the silence doesn’t get weird.	0
1	They will be remarried to (if even possible) a worse man	I was speaking more worldwide and not just Afghani women...though I guess your comment still rings true.	0
1	It is a red flag. If she is as great as she has led my son to believe why isn’t she already married? She said that she didn’t want to date while she was in college and building a career but I think that is a bunch of bologna.	Are you seriously this obtuse? You’re embracing yourself with this comment.	0
1	Conversation is when 2 people say something to each others	“Conversation - a talk, especially an informal one, between two or more people, in which news and ideas are exchanged.”  What ideas were exchanged?	0
1	Lesbians are attracted exclusively attracted to other women. Political lesbianism is a homophonic movement.	Oh yeah yeah yeah, I'm familiar with the term.	0
1	I mean they wont have sex with their husbands but....	Lol the sexless marriage trope is overplayed. Married people have more sex on average than single people.	0
1	Antidepressants and depression	I feel ya. And you're making the right choice. Medicine is constantly improving, maybe soon it won't even be an issue.	0
1	I think a part of it might be because people that wait until marriage are mostly religious and you know divorce is frowned upon in religions.	But what would that have to do with self reported marriage satisfaction? It’s not only looking at divorce rates, it’s also looking at satisfaction within the marriage.	0
1	People can go to a parade and support gay people without being gay themselves, to be fair.	To be fair...  member =/= supporter	0
1	You can’t judge every single one as the same or you will never get anyway the same as they should not judge every single man as the same	I'm perfectly fine isolating myself from women.	0
1	I don't think chatting or meeting for lunch or dinner would be considered cheating lol anyways I am talking having sexual intercourse with another woman that not your wife, I was curious to see the punishment for it	Obviously there is. Adultery plus zina	0
1	This gives me hope.. I just got out of a relationship where I felt like a worn out mom.. sigh	Give yourself a spa day (home or out), kick back and listen to the sweet sound of no more man-child bullshit!  Then recalibrate your stud finder. ;)	0
1	If that was the case the law should apply equally regardless of which sex is involved, but that’s not the case here.   It’s one sided.	Has there been cases in Spain of men being killed because of their gender? If so, they should make this neutral.	0
1	Why is this subreddit even allowed?? Imagine if the genders where switched, makes you think doesn't it?	Lemme guess, the patriarchy and the gender pay gap?	0
1	It happened SO MUCH right at the beginning of the pandemic. So many meetings, especially women's only or LGBT ones, were zoombombed by people saying horrible things, posting porn, posting pictures of lynchings. It was a nightmare.	I was in one that was zoombombed. It was so fucking irritating. These morons have nothing better to do than to harass people. It’s AA, not a CoD game.	0
1	It's a natural process and it's nothing to be ashamed of, try to control it, if you can't control it, don't feel bad have patience with yourself, you're going to have a lot of feelings like that growing up  Just whatever you do, don't go to pornography	I wouldn't say masturbation is natural, the only natural way to get rid of semen is wet dreams other than that you are just forcing it out and it gives you a dopamine rush that makes want to do it more	0
1	Hang in there!  I also have an incurable condition with a &gt;50% chance I'll end up in a wheelchair. Married 5 years after getting my diagnosis, 15 years ago, he's not turned LV yet.  It can and does happen. Don't settle.	I won’t settle.	0
1	Depends how much you want your neighbours/parents/sibling/housemates/other people in the nearby area to know you're having sex I guess.	Well i think my upstairs neighbours are trying to flex on me cause i can hear them at least 4 times a week, so i'll have to up my game too.	0
1	Yikes man, just because you like incest, doesn’t mean everyone does	Lmao, have a nice night	0

1	fds is too easy to make a post on imo	Fair enough I just wanted to point it out lol	0
1	I don’t see how you would move a king sized box spring in and out of a normal home. They must all be twins.	Every king bed I've ever seen has the 2 twin box springs but since I haven't seen them all, I didn't want to flat out say that. I assume the reason is because of what you just said. They don't bend so it would be really hard to get them in a room.	0
1	In their minds, accepting gay people into society and not treating non-whites as second class is that ‘extreme liberal’ shift they hate so much.	Yep. The US, where basic human rights are debatable!	0
1	I just asked you a question, you turned it into some weird shit about your incest fantasy.	Where art thou, smelly cunt? Oh I forgot: you're banned in this sub! Ha ha ha.	0
1	That's like saying single fathers or gay couples who have daughters wouldn't know proper hygiene practices for periods. If you don't know, you should research it before the child is born	Forced hystorectomy, yeah! That'll even the score, you dick butchers!  /s	0
1	When did the partys switch?	Are you actually asking that in earnest? Here's a documentary for you. https://ny.pbslearningmedia.org/resource/amex26-soc-64ntsouth/1964-the-south-changes-political-parties/	0
1	I will never understand why people still take children to these places and threaten them with hell.	I've read arguments:  * The Best Education * No Community Elsewhere * Relatives Were There Too * Voted For Theocracy * Not That Bad (also It's Just School) * Secular Bad Too * Children Decide It First Hand	0
1	Unless you have children, you don’t get an opinion on this. And someone with children shared this opinion, they don’t deserve their children. I would VIOLENTLY unalive my husband to save my children.	The violently unalive part is waaay excessive.	1
1	While the Bible basically doesn’t even touch on the topic of trans people, based on his commands to treat gay people, I’m not sure he’d approve of trans people either.	You're really never going to give up your "James Dobson is right, Jerry Falwell is right, down with LGBT Christians" crusade, are you?	1

1	Male bisexuality isn't seen as gross by most women. Hell, the yaoi (gay men Manga) market is a huge mess directed towards female teenagers, and it's booming better than ever before.	Yea it is . I'm bisexual and the amount I've seen bi guys get bashed by straight and pan women not to mention gay me as well is quite concerning.	0
1	Nah if you go anywhere in the world except for your Europe, ppl don’t really accept the LGBT like that	Australia, USA, Asian, Canada are pretty chill ?  the map show it’s legal anyway	0
1	As someone who is not a Roman Catholic, I generally find that they have the best track record when it comes to speaking truly on the issue of sexuality in our modern time	But they’re citing a passage where someone prevented gay sex by having guys rape his daughters, how is that okay?	0
1	We just want common sense abortion control laws to prevent the unjust homicides of so so many innocent children	A one year waiting period and a total ban on assault abortions.	0
1	Non sequitur means "doesn't follow" and it completely does follow up with my point. Sexualization doesn't follow skateboarding or child media.	Talking about lgbt people doesn't mean sexualization	0
1	Even as someone who is pro-abortion, this is way too much. Abortion is an extreme last resort measure after a long line of other things that could've been done before. It's not fun, cute or something to be comemorated. It's a fucked up moment.	Completely agree use a condom and some other contraceptive before anything	0
1	Fake news is one hell of a drug.	Outrage is a legit addiction. Faux news (and many other outlets) do anything they can to give their users a hit.  Edit:  For more info:  https://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2014/01/angry-politics-americans-addicted-101735/	0
1	Can confirm so far! My Dad stayed and helped me take care of Mom diligently for 33yrs. Hubby and I have been married for 11, I have PPMS and he's by my side as much as he can be. I give everything I can to care for him too.	Yeah, my step mom has had RRMS for over a decade and my peppep has stayed with her the whole time.	0

1	I hate to say it, but I agree with her take. I do think there’s a problem with young men consuming too much porn and it definitely isn’t as healthy as people think. Porn is like many other addictions, which have negative side effects if overused.	Everyone knows and accepts that excessive pron is not good for health, but to blame ED on just pron is ignorant.	0
1	Hmm, why is what she does with his permission any of our business? They appear to be consenting adults.	His body, his choice.     She has no right to pressurize him. Even if she is his wife.	0
1	Since they are a F/F couple I'm guessing OP used the sperm from her wife's brother. That way they are biologically related to both parents.	i get the reasoning for bio relation, but that's just asking for trouble and that's exactly what the OP got	0
1	Born again virgin! It allows you to be a whore, then when it is time to settle down you can say you are a (born again ) virgin.	Maybe being virgin is just a social construct. Or even a gender. Who knows.	0
1	It's a bit of an on-again, off-again relationship.	Maybe he's finally done turning a blind eye to Cult 45	0
1	they are trying to be so serious with the whole "phobia" stuff, but i cant take them seriously at all. i mean really man, GDSphobia?😂😂	Labeling those who disagree with them as "phobic" is an attempt to pathologize, make their opponent look sick.	0
1	holy shit. how much are drinks where you are? i dont drink, im underage	They by rounds of drinks for friends and buy deals of x amount of shots for £5-£15 or something like that	0
1	Child custody. An absolute tragedy	Yes absolutely, that’s a big one.  Going back like over 100 years honestly.	0
1	It's a sin mainly because the Lord said it is unclean. Please ,everybody must understand that.  It's not because The Lord hates homosexual men.	Why did he say it’s unclean if he doesn’t hate gay men?	0
1	It is a red flag. If she is as great as she has led my son to believe why isn’t she already married? She said that she didn’t want to date while she was in college and building a career but I think that is a bunch of bologna.	You basically admitted she's not good enough for your son, does it really matter to you if she was married before or are you just looking for a reason in that scenario to admit that you hate her	0

1	“virgin” mary.	What about her?	0
1	Or they could try to have a serious conversation and try to fix things, possibly with the help of couples counseling. Divorce is a valid option, but it’s kind of weird how it’s the first suggestion people always jump to.	That's something you do *before* getting all passive-agressive	0
1	https://www.eeoc.gov/sexual-harassment  "Harassment does not have to be of a sexual nature, however, and can include offensive remarks about a person's sex."  I think your ignorant comments on gender identity qualify.	We'll need to agree to disagree there.	0
1	Again, the OP’s CMV is incest should be normalized for everyone not incest should be normalized if you’re gay, infertile, or sterilized.	Everyone can have anal sex, oral sex and non-penetrative sex and I am pretty sure those don’t result in pregnancy.	0
1	A story as old as time as they say.  If you don't want to have kids, get a vasectomy. Highly recommend it.	Tried that, got denied by multiple doctors telling me I needed my wifes consent... i was 18 and unmarried.	0
1	Ted needs to be on a no fly list.	America needs to be a on a No Ted list	0
1	That's like saying single fathers or gay couples who have daughters wouldn't know proper hygiene practices for periods. If you don't know, you should research it before the child is born	Yeah you SHOULD, you’re assuming all parents are “good parents”	0
1	Interesting that was the only comparison you could think of. But not full accurate. I believe only the only conjoined twins that cannot be separated are ones that share a heart.	So, take the ones who cannot be separated. Are they alive?	0

1	YTA-it’s not micromanaging, it’s patenting.   you had an opportunity to teach your son how to be honest and upfront and you didn’t.  ‘He didn’t know how to break up with her” was your chance to guide him.   Kids need to learn how to communicate.	Agreed! He’s too old to be parented but too young to be responsible for his actions and how they impact others…… NOPE!	0
1	She said they've been married 8 months, and tge wife died a year ago. That means tgey got married max 4 months after she died! Who does this??	Weirdly it’s not that unusual. Men often get married again quite quickly, women tend to wait longer.	0
1	Got married.	These aren’t the responses I want to see when I plan on proposing next week	0
1	What about being friends because you genuinely enjoy their company? Doesn’t that count for something even if there is no opportunity for sex directly or indirectly?	Then you aren’t really in the “Friend Zone” right? I feel like it implies wanting a relationship but being stuck as friends. If a love interest rejects me but I’m fine with being around them as just friends, I wouldn’t say I’m in the Friend Zone.	0
1	That doesn't mean the government should start pushing trans stuff on kids...	Which government is doing what?	1
1	You didn’t look into Drag Queen Story Hour at all, did you?	Honestly. No. I'm on mobile right not its hard to switch back and forth between tabs. Can you summarize it for me? I understand you might say shit Luke I'm just lazy. If that's all you got I'll see you	0
1	For you married couples out there, it sounds like it would likely be $125k for an individual, or $250k for married couples filing jointly.  So double income couples shouldn't worry about that $125k figure.	Thanks for the reminder	0
1	I was banned from FDS while on here. I thought that it was funny. I didn't even say anything crazy either. But they must be nervous if those mods are looking on other Reddits to block folks.	Same. Within 5 minutes I was banned off FDS	0
1	How would Reddit handle a group that was explicitly against the rights of women, POC and LGBTQ people? I’m sure that the people in this misandrist group would find such groups offensive and demand that they be removed immediately.	Are you saying it’s pointless to reach out and try to establish a platform for reasonable communication? And I don’t think this group is for anything you said, it’s just against feminism.  You can be a woman and not a feminist my guy	0
1	Nooo not at all.	Meaning of course, that it's clearly intentional....	0
1	Except the whole point is that TERFs use "biological women" to imply that trans women are not women.	The vast majority of people don't though. You can't force a language change just to cater to a very small number of people	0

1	Pros of vibrator:  \- doesn't watch porn when you are out of the house  \- stays hard and doesn't have ED  \- doesn't give STD's/get you pregnant  \- doesn't cheat on you with your younger sister  ETC	Your vibrator doesn't yell at you when it doesn't orgasm	0
1	But they *are* pro-life. You can't fuck kids if they get aborted.	How is the human trafficking industry supposed to survive without a steady supply of kids for the system to lose? Helloo?! Jobs!?!	0
1	Husband does this ALL. THE. TIME.    The funny thing is he does this to impress me.  He wants to wow me with a little nugget of information that he has, but doesn't remember where he got it.	My husband does this all the time to me too.	0
1	Why would it be trans issues? If you believe the shooter was trans, that was debunked.	Sauce? I would like that information shared as often as possible.	0
1	Soda is a shit vice to have. If you're gonna be addicted to a drink, at least have it be alcohol	I have a bad liver idiot. So drinking might put me in a much earlier grave. Plus it killed my fucking grandpa. How fucking dare you.	0
1	Except they probably won’t go down that road? Are you under the impression that most adults fuck hookers?	Nope. Just saying it may be an option for SOME people uncomfortable getting back into relationships if they’re apprehensive.  Just agreeing with OP’s unpopular opinion. For the record I don’t frequent hookers	0
1	Bro there are plenty of cases of harassment after inter religion marriages.  Also wtf is forced conversion ? They are adults not kids to force	If you think there are no forced conversions in marriages you are dead stupid and no one can argue with you...fk you	0

1	I'm a lesbian and I've actively worked to have a life as free of cishet men as possible. After leaving my last job that had a mansplainer coworker and a fake ally liberal boss man, I'm back to my preferred life of only queer women, gay men, and my dad.	Oh man, sometimes I *wish* I was a lesbian - if things go south with my current guy is there like a course I could take?	0
1	&gt; others being calling homosexuality degeneration or a disorder in a persons psychosexual development  Mind telling me what part of the bible that’s from?	I didn't claim it was from the Bible.	0
1	I can’t possibly be human filth if I don’t support grooming kids with lgbt filth, I might be gay but I won’t support corrupting kids with the burdens of a death cult	This is not happening you made a scenario in your mind a you believe its true. But you know what fuck it, you are pedophile now, and all cishet people are now pedos. By your own logic this would make sense. No?	1
1	FDS version 2 lol. Post this shit in other subs. Thats how FDS got kicked.	Unfortunately the truth is FDS was never kicked.	0
1	Like u don't know what a condom is??? Or you're suggesting it???	i must’ve missed where you talked about condoms. my bad	0
1	I like to do that with my exes every year or so, the ones I’m friendly with. I don’t stop caring about them just because it ended. We dated for a reason.	This seems like a regular, normal connection though (even yearly), which is fine. But when someone schedules messaging you every 5-10 years or so, it's odd.	0
1	I would agree that there could be some environmental factors at play  But “grooming”? Like, adults manipulating children to be gay? Where’s your evidence that this is a thing outside of it being just another Fox News issue du jour?	I believe adults can manipulate children into doing certain activities. Catholic church scandals do come to mind. (Now, was it all rape in the eyes of children even though under the law, they can't consent.)	0
1	That’d be cool if that was possible but you don’t really just “get” a new sexual orientation	Anyways, just come to God :)	0
1	Yeah I don't feel people have the right to know what I'm carrying or see what metal devices I have on me. That's an invasion of my privacy. Children are forced to go to school, they can't opt out of this violation of their rights.	There are plenty of automatic screening devices. Banning a gun is already a  infringement on people’s right and additional screening could at least make such infringement has some positive effects. Otherwise, I see no reason to ban a gun.	0
1	Except in her son’s eyes, the only reason they’re in such financial straits that his college fund and his father’s favorite car were taken away was because she chose to get remarried.	Sounds like the son needs therapy. Just because the son sees it thay way, doesn't mean that's how it is	0
1	The only substantial study on watching porn, found it benefited more than half the group studied. There is no fucking chance I am submitting to moderation in my porn.	Im basically saying by moderation is that you shouldnt become addicted to porn and let it control your life, im all for enjoying porn. Im just rebuting all the NoFap and anti-porn shit on this sub.	0
1	Still waiting for transphobes to come with better "jokes" :/	We'll both be waiting an eternity, then. ugh!	0
1	Not liking condoms is not a boundary. Not having sex with someone who won’t use a condom is a boundary.	Both are valid boundaries.   Just be honest and find a match	0
1	Lets just hope it doesnt become an "everything is transphobic" subreddit.	I always have the Ban hammer  And don't worry I am a memeber of the LGBTQ so I am with the Trans people (unless they become toxic)	0
1	&gt; Much of the discrimination in education is against boys who are children, not men  The issue here is college and they don't normally admit children.	The discrimination against boys in K-12 education is one of the reasons fewer males are enrolling in college.    Read Christina Hoff Summer’s excellent book on the subject.	0
1	You don't think it's wrong that transgenders are succeeding in every female sport and stealing scholarships? How about they have their own league?	>You don't think it's wrong that transgenders are succeeding in every female sport and stealing scholarships?  You think this is a common occurrence? Also do you think estrogen builds muscle?	1
1	Lol voters don't give the slightest fucking shit about large corporations. They care about the price of gas and whatever the culture war du jour is. Voters want him to lower the price of gas by 80 cents and say some bigoted shit about trans kids.	That’s only republican voters. They are suckers for politicians that say bigoted shit.	0

1	so if i was dating a girl, i would need to have someone like my brother there, while i am with the girl?	that is right	0
1	No, that's not what it says. Can you address my example? If someone said being gay is not immoral would you rebut that with a dad raping their child? I hope not.  That's literally what they said, just swapping gay for incest.	> No, that's not what it says.   I know that's not what it says. I said it was broad and *possible* read it that way. OP has since clarified that's not what they meant, which is why I asked.	0
1	You forgot to add non-binary people. Stop being transphobic you bigot.	>You forgot to add non-binary people. Stop being transphobic you bigot.  exactly that's a further proof that feminists AReeeeeee transphobicrEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE	0
1	It's a euphoria filter 😂😂 . So unrelated to the video. At first I thought the makeup was on her actual face so shen she said she was getting ready to go to work I thought she was getting ready to shoot porn or something.	She isn't? 😳 I sincerely thought she was a SW.	0
1	It’s his choice to do whatever he wants with his body.   It’s your choice whether or not you want to stay in the marriage.	Do this thing or I'll financially and mentally hurt you  It's not a choice, it's the illusion of such.	0
1	Its not that difficult to understand. If you are into the guy, his advances wont bother you and you'll give him signals to continue. If you are not into him, you reject him and that should be it. But guys dont seem to get it	That might be because we aren’t mind readers, most female “signals” are vague and ambiguous at best.	0
1	That's ridiculous. If someone is gay then obviously they are part of LGBTQ lmao. It's like saying if someone loses his vision then they are not part of the blind community. Makes no sense.	Are you dense? If you associate yourself with the LGBTQ it's haram, it's basically supporting what they do.	0
1	I’m blown away that OP married this guy! Was he that good at hiding who he was through their entire relationship up until just now? Talk about playing the long game.	Yea why would she marry someone who divorced his last wife because she had cancer? What if OP gets sick? Men like this deserve nobody	0
1	Exactly! But he won’t do it, because he wants the emotional support that comes with being in a relationship while he acts up and claim he is the price. Oh the audacity.	Yes, they not only want free sex, they also want free emotional labor from women.	0
1	When a literal babies meet and happen to be opposite sex, people start talking about how they'll marry some day. Wth, that's gross.	sure, but that's not what sexualised means. romanticised, yeah. but not sexualised.	0
1	&gt;Alas, now she’s telling me that actually he wants to do it for HER.  The only way I'm buying this is if he's a straight man asking for a threesome with her and another man.	It would happen only if he had this type of kink, not because the woman is asking .	0
1	Because he only saw marriage for sex only	No wonder he masturbated. He doesn't understand the true essence of marriage. May Allaah guide him	0
1	Sorry, I'm confused.  I thought we were talking about what pregnant means.	You are confused. We were talking about whether the Bible considers a fetus a person. It clearly and explicitly does not. It’s also not written in English.	0
1	Forget anal or BDSM.	And no 3somes or an open relationship...these so called empowered PickMes cannot be serious	0
1	I'd be more upset if my husband thought I was cheating, than if the doctor thought I didn't have sex.  Obviously they need counseling or a divorce.	What should he think of you haven’t had sex in 3 years and you say a few months?	0

1	As legal as "marital stalking".  Just because the term "marital *whatever*" isn't mentioned in the laws, doesn't mean it's legal. Rape is rape.	Sure but marital rape wasn't seen as something that exist. Don't try to deny it you would be just objectively wrong if you did	0
1	I got married at one of Henry ford's old factories that got turned into a small museum. It was the most Detroit things ever.	That's pretty cool! Maybe we'll switch our venue to the National Soccer Hall of Fame.	0
1	Transphobes also exist	Non-bi is not trans.	0
1	My point is, if there is a child. What is in best interest if said child?	The rape victim should get the right to put the child up for anonymous adoption or raising it themselves. Giving a rapist primary custody isn't in the child's best interest.	0
1	As I write that you must be one of those low value men they speak of. As I sing Janet Jackson song what have you done for me lately.     Relationships are a partnership where two people together can achieve as much as three people separately.	You look like a cuck	0
1	&gt; but that's unhealthy and doesn't make them feel better.  Exactly. As opposed to transitioning as a treatment for gender dysphoria, which is not that unhealthy and vastly improves trans people’s well being.	r/detrans	0

1	It’s weird and it’s super lazy on your dad’s part. He’s outsourcing his relationship work to you. Are you going to have sex with your mom next?  Relationships don’t work this way. Tell your dad this is not something you feel comfortable doing.	I agree with this. He could just go online and find a good restaurant where he can outsource this to pros, schedule a couples massage, etc. not that hard. It’s weird he’s asking you this and more importantly it’s out of your comfort zone	0

1	Yeah but this isn't about cranking one off, it's about having a loving relationship with a partner.	The issue is women get a dildo and claim they don’t need men. But when men don’t need them as proven then that’s a problem.Trust me we can do without a relationship, most men just want the consistent sex.	0

1	Wait prostitution is illegal in your country? What a silly thing to make illegal. That only makes it less safe for sex workers and their clients, and makes trafficking and extortion easier.	Its only illegal becaue the government cant tax it properly Edit: should of read down a bit,lol.	0
1	I think it wasn’t legal, but it wasn’t illegal either? Because marriage was done to be able to have sex or something, so it wasn’t considered as a think to say no after marriage or something	You think in Finland in 1997 if a husband raped his wife, it would be legal for him to do so? Can you use your brain please and think things through?	0

1	I'm not changing the meaning of marriage.  The OP has said he/she also means when the marriage lifestyle commences. In that, is included sex.  You are a serious danger if you are arguing against the need for someone to be physically ready for that.	Op said that later on in a comment, but what op asked is just marriage and that’s what I answered, I didn’t say anything wrong in my answer, so stop trying to win.	0

1	His brother has made the rules though, the only way OP would be disregarding those rules is if he showed up at the wedding with his gf. Saying he won't go without her is not stopping his brother from making the rules.	As I said, I don’t feel that the rules are right. It is the brother’s wedding though so it’s his right to make the rules. OP stood their ground and let the family know his stance. He does not have to attend.	0
1	&gt; In what way is the trans movement allies to MRAs?  The claim was that the trans movement was an ally of MRAs, so I asked in what way. I don't see that you are answering either.	Then could you specify what specifically you want me to say?	0
1	Wait those were the only times they had sex? I figured with how close they were they’d be going at it, especially if either one of them had the libido Edward VII had	I don’t think she meant literally every single time, I think she just meant it happened more frequently than she wanted it to. Keep in mind that after a point they started abstaining more to prevent having more kids than they wanted	0
1	&gt;Why should a child be given the same rights as an adult?    Until they are 18 they aren't. Kids do not have anywhere near the same rights as an adult does.	Do adults have the right to kill their children?	0
1	The same could be said about your opinion that a man should be able to abandon a child just as a woman can abort one. That position assumes a fetus and a child are equal	But a woman can abandon a child with no problem. A man cannot, she can both abort and abandon with zero consequences. A man can neither abort a pregnancy or abandon a child.	0
1	Trust me we are just as annoyed as you are for this bs just take a damn joke dude I joke about being a lesbian all the time there’s nothing you can say say that offends me because I actually accept myself.	Great way to look at life.  Much respect.	0
1	Well, what is this "popular transgender ideology"?	I think it’s that there is no differences between trans women/men and biological women/men, which is not true	0
1	Why should your sexual identity be apart of your job? I don’t walk around when speaking to clients and say, hey I’m a heterosexual like that is some semblance of a personality?	So you'd be OK being barred from mentioning a spouse?	1

1	Gay people grow up absolutely inundated with media about straight people. It doesn't make them straight.  Media featuring gay relationships cannot make someone gay.	How do you know?  There may well be potential gay people who became straight, and potential straight people who became gay, because of media, expectations, physical contact, whatever.	0
1	A. K-3 students have no clue about sexuality, teachers don't need to be discussing it with them.   B. It never mentions the word gay, any discussion about sexuality would be violating the rule.	The phrase "only specific to black people" didn't appear in Jim Crow laws but everybody knew who they were meant for.	0
1	But.. this is not what I asked. I asked you what in your mind the difference is between an open relationship (non-monogamous) and a polygamous one.	They're entirely different things - there is no comparison at all.  Polygamy is about marriage. Threesomes are about sex. I genuinely have no idea what comparison you're trying to make here.	0
1	Aren't they right now bitterly divided between the Feminists that include transgender people as women and the ones that just want biological women in their movement?	Sort through controversial and you'll find trans related comments there.	0
1	I don't think I need to explain, but let's continue this charade:  Homophobia can also be insinuating someone's sexuality is homosexual in order to make *them* feel bad. Because it perpetuates that there is something wrong with it.	Why would eleven year old boys be sexual?	0
1	you're delusional, but sure, living in your own little world, is one of the most common forms of escapism.	nah not so much delusional just really ducking entertained at the tantrums some men have on here	0
1	So do you guilt trip your parents that they don't do anything to keep the relationship going? Or is that reserved for your daughter?	No. The relationship in all directions needs to change. I was agreeing with you. It shouldn't be on my daughter to manage their expectations. It isn't fair I forced her to keep putting out effort she didn't receive in kind.	0
1	No. Circumcision is a pretty large part of christianity for traditional reasons and the symbolism. And i'd rather not be doing that now. Baby is much better	As a Christian myself, no. Circumcision is not required for Christianity. The majority of Christians in the world are uncut. There are verses in the Bible stating its not required at all and gives you no benefit for salvation.	0

1	The point is to speak on the love and how it’s impacted by marriage. I feel there is no impact when it comes to love, therefore marriage is pointless in terms of love. It must be about something else like tax cuts, etc	Marriage is about partnership.	0
1	Yes of course. Because if he is not providing, what’s the point of marrying?	You have a crappy attitude. Equivalent of the guys who constantly talk about obedience and mention divorce if their wife doesn’t have sex with them one time 💀.

1	Swapping.  Not necessarily group swinging but like couple swapping in the same room.	Same. Irl I’d be like that guy that immediately regrets it and is cringing in the corner	0
1	Still i disagree, If there was a hell yeah putin may get his share but that means millions of Innocent would go through hell (If the Religious hell is considered). Atheist , Gay etc. So Yeah cons clearly out weigh pros.	The Jewish victims od Auschwitz would have gone to hell, whereas their oppressor had a confession and maybe absolution before being executed, so he may now be basking in the glory of god.	0
1	Early 20s isn’t actually being an adult. If you still feel the same way at 30 let me know.	How is it not the same as being a "real adult" if you're in your early 20s? They're literally legal adults in every way and pay bills and all that jazz people go on about.	0
1	That's like saying people who regularly go to the bar for alcohol are going to try to find a solution at the bar as well. I don't know why it's so hard for you to admit porn addiction might be a prevalent problem, but I can guess.	It would be like that if the internet was a bar.	0
1	Vaginal sex recieving: females only? What kinda transphobic shit is this?	only female people have vaginas lol	0
1	Ex porn star?  Ehhh not quite, the internet is forever there my dear and I'm pretty sure youre still like top ten on the ole Hub so lets just forego the whole "ex" thing.	Yeah that’s like saying “former prostitute” or “ex-murderer”….once you’ve banged people for money you’re a whore. Once you’ve murdered someone you’re a murderer.   She is what she is….	0
1	rape porn is a thing, you know??	Dude, there’s every kind of porn for every kind of person, regardless of gender or whatever characteristic. There are always sickos, but these feminists seem to think that these sickos represent all men, a mistake they make frighteningly often.	0
1	There are arguments against just about everything.  But you can’t disprove solipsism.  People are entitled to believe what they choose:	But do you have arguments tho? 🆘	0
1	What the FUCK. I had no idea this was the case in the UK. That's absolutely fucked.	It's well-documented that carrying weapons for 'self-defence' puts you more at risk.	0
1	Why don’t you go to the FDS sub or something?	Why would I do that?	0
1	You are technically correct, but in reality if you talk to someone who blanket refuses to date trans people, 100 times out of 100 you will find that they are transphobic.	If you're not into trans people then you're transphobic? I'm not into gay guys, but that doesn't make me homophobic. Why do I have to find everyone attractive?	0
1	It is okay for men and women to have preferences on what they want in the opposite sex .	I absolutely agree, however, feminists would disagree and label the man as a misogynistic .	0
1	why people still married?	i sort of feel like i should avoid dating and marriage entirely but part of me feels like i just have to trust that my partner will do the right thing	0
1	Yes, also they’ve been married 10 years and presumably dated before that. Does he have some kind of learning need that it still hasn’t sunk in that she cares about birthdays?	yeah, he's suffering from a severe case of women-aren't-worth-listening-to-itis	0
1	Child birth is natural, child birth with no father is a miracle.	No its cloning. A lot of natural things are miracles.	0
1	You should get married but to the right person. A spouse can make or break your entire life and career	How about correct the vile evil laws. No one marries thinking they married the wrong person.	0
1	Like the LGBTQ movement excludes straight people? Or is this one of those rules for thee but not for me things?	Yeah that's not a thing. I'm part of the LGBTQ community and the only straight people we exclude are homophobes and transphobes. Sure, there are shitty LGBTQ individuals but it has nothing to do with their sexuality or gender identity.	0
1	Pickmes do be doing god's work by taking lvm/nvm out of the dating scene 🥴	God's work... Nah sis. It's horrible this happens, even though it likely HAS to happen before anything changes. I'd rather not see LVM/NVM locked down at all. It teaches them that SOMEONE out of all these people is okay with their shitty behaviour.	0
1	Oh yeah, the pre-wedding thing. It can get pretty gross. My friend's bride-to-be went on such a severe crash diet to "look good in the pictures" that all her hair fell out and she probably did permanent organ damage. So, I hope she enjoys those pics!	There’s a lot of pressure on brides to “look their best” (aka often their thinnest). It’s really unfortunate. Your wedding day would hopefully be a day to celebrate your partnership, but it can often be a lot of anxiety	0
1	You mean mod games right ?	I mean emulating console games on your phone.	0
1	Also bring up attempt rates as though most men would report a failed attempt and ignore that you cannot attempt again if you’re dead.  Classic whataboutism.	guys are more effective at killing themselves according to the stats like when they try they tend to actually die	0
1	I think you’re confused. I didn’t say these were on FDS. When did I say these were on FDS?	>FDS might not be a troll sub. But as far as taking jokes go, there’s been a few people that took jokes about men dying in wars or men being useless or any other jokes	0
1	Fair enough. We have different experiences of TBMs.  But you don’t disagree about the racism, sexism and homophobia part, right?	Of course not.	0
1	Children stolen from their people to be indoctrinated in Christianity, alienated from parents, and murdered in Canada and Australia for example.	This!	0
1	Omg I barely trust the mechanics at auto shops to work on my car and not screw me over or mess something up. Imagine trusting a random guy off a dating app 😬 that dude is delusional!	My step-dad or male cousin tags along when I go into the shop. I only take ittp the shop. The audacityof a scrote to trick me into coming over and messing with my transportation is so scary.	0
1	I'm a transhumanist but I don't support faulty surgeries that cause infertility	How many trans people want to have children using their biological reproductive organs?	1
1	Not leaving the house for weeks is depression, not being an introvert.	Not always, I just have everything I need at home	0
1	What's your thoughts on the thousands of childfree men and women or married couples who don't want kids? Should they just.. never have sex?	They should try for a child if they are able to care for it and if they want it	0
1	Following your reasoning, all people would be single the moment they become old, with wrinkles and saggy skin. You clearly don’t know what love is… So vain.	I mean, you're pretty naive to think that I dont view relationships as more than a physical exchange.  How about you rub two braincells together and consider what I actually said and not what your agenda makes you think.	0
1	I only heard from Terry Crews admitting porn addiction, and to be honest, nobody can shame that guy.	Lots of people still did when he talked about being molested :/	0
1	Wildly inappropriate. Elementary school kids shouldn't even be taken to regular bar much less a gay bar.  Board members don't usually lead field trips...so I have to really question what happened here.	If parents resist, they'll be labeled 'domestic terrorists.' Isn't that how this works?	0
1	The basic premise is to just look at modern day dating and going "Fuck this shit, I'm out".	So hateful towards women....  /s	0
1	Well all my close friends are not douches, so no one in our circle gets shamed.  And who is disclosing the fact they are a virgin to their co-workers?  Learn to know what to share and whom to share it with lol. Basic social skills 101.	You do know that you are just one person right? I'm glad none of your friends are dickheads, but some people are assholes behind your back.	0
1	Want huge debt on them? I’d say the opposite although wedding maybe exception	Tuition enables self sufficiency imo. Wedding is for pleasure.   You can only pay for wedding if you have an education	0
1	Trans women certainly are not women .  It's simple biology.	Biological yes you are correct mentally no	1
1	It’s like they don’t take in to account that most the people accused of Pedophilia are heterosexuals.	And Republicans apparently	0
1	In today's society though, it gets swept under the rug if a 15 yr old boy has sex with an adult woman. It wouldn't make the news like vice versa would	You might be right. I'm old and suspect there has been progress in that regard. I suspect women are less likely to get away with it than they used to be.	0
1	ok i did  sorry letting pregnancy slip for any reason even if by accident no matter what her reason for keeping it secret earns a YTA from me.   Its not ok.	But OP was never told it was a secret or to keep it from her brother. Also OPs sister is 8 months pregnant, any rando walking past her knows she's pregnant. It's not a secret	0
1	I'm immune to her shenanigans because I'm a Gay Male, and male homos don't wear lipstick. Unless I was kidnapped by Buffalo Bill and getting lipstick'd was my punishment for not PUTTING THE LOTION IN THE GAWD DAMN BASKET.	Fuck is wrong with you	0
1	It is a red flag. If she is as great as she has led my son to believe why isn’t she already married? She said that she didn’t want to date while she was in college and building a career but I think that is a bunch of bologna.	Because she hadn’t met your son yet, duh.	0
1	Yes, I'm guessing you think the Bible says homosexuality isn't a sin.	The Bible says a lot of things.	1
1	Yeah I’m not sure how these 2 get getting connected.  I had this argument on this sub last week of all places. They are not the same things.  Abortions seem to be covered by the 10th. Firearms are covered by the 2nd.	Idk if it's brigading or this sub is full of squishes but lately there's been a disturbing amount of pro-abortion peoppe in this sub claiming to be conservative.	0
1	No I just wanted to call out bullshit so I used your own pornhub search against you Ms.	Yawn. I’m not going to make an effort if you won’t. Go wank to some porn.	0
1	mans thinks porn addict is normal bloke  have you ever touched a girl	I think the accusation of being addicted to porn is so over used its lost any meaning. Of course you're still acting like a complete and total pussy, and not in a good way either.	0
1	Saw someone say that a moderate democrat and a libertarian would sit by and watch as a republican beat up a gay guy cause they dont care. I feel like most people here haven't been outside since 2020.	Just completely ridiculous hyperbole with tons of upvotes lol Biden admin has been historically supportive of LGBTQ issues and the Equality Act already passed the House with no democrats voting against it. But who needs facts? Lol	0
1	Ughhhh first amendment much? They are free to say whatever they want just like you and I are.	True but considering how much they’re stepping all over the first amendment rights of everyone else especially with advocating for vaccine mandates/passports I think we can make an exception.	0
1	To formalize OP’s responsibilities. If the baby is theirs, fine. If it’s not, then that’s the answer.	Ohhhh	0
1	You can’t call this one a Hoax mate, the whole fuckin’ world tuned in and watched	Why did capitol police open the doors and wave people inside?	0
1	You understand that date rape drugs don't take effect immediately, yes?	Wouldn't he just wait until they do then?  Still r/thathappened.	0
1	Bride and Groom did.	Maybe the bride picked you to keep the Money prize in the family, and eventually to split the prize with her😅	0
1	Teenager ranges from thir*teen* to nine*teen*, teenager =/= child	Nope, you are not correct, at all. 18 and older, at least in the USA, is considered an adult and a woman. A teenager is usually considered a child, usually 17 and younger.	0
1	I doubted it was real when OP says they’ve never been on reddit then immediately says they were using a throwaway. If you’ve never used reddit you wouldn’t need a throwaway?!	Also in one of her comments she said it looked exactly like one of the Bored Apes, and the cheapest of these ones costs 53 ETH or 218,176 USD, a bit more than 8000.	0
1	Trans women don’t get periods even after fully transitioning and I’m not sure about trans men but I’m pretty sure they don’t have balls so I don’t think even a trans person could answer this question.	They can get prosthetics, but not real testicles.	0
1	Because most of those guys are perverts themselves, while expecting their partners to be modest	Men who sleep around are perverts?   I think you have the definition of pervert wrong. You have to be into some type of fringe porn stuff to be a pervert.   Regular guys who use their charm to attract women are not perverts.	0
1	What?! Caitlyn Jenner IS trans, mind you	And she got so much enjoyment out of vehicular manslaughter the first time, she ended up making a career out of throwing trans kids under the fucking bus. She'll get what she's owed eventually	0
1	I thought you had to be 18 to work at sex stores.   So you identify as a demon and a child? Is this at the same time or separate times?	I don't work at a sex store I work at a Spencer's.   I don't identify as a demon or a child. I have alters, and one does identity as a demon and the other is a literal 6 year old child.	0
1	I am. you wanna make out or what?	No u post to much star treck lol	0
1	Are u kidding?	No it’s a serious question why would I be kidding..?	0
1	Being banned from FDS is a blessing. Remember what acronym FDS stands for - Fuggly Dateless Shrews.	Fat dateless skanks as well	0
1	I just looked at that subreddit for about 30 seccond for the first time. I saw a post using Transphobia and Sexual abuse to make a point against all men. Gods above... I'm sorry man but your comment is a lost cause. I salute you brave soldier.	Not all may be lost perhaps one person really sits back for a second and thinks “what am i doing here” and maybe stops this whole stupid gender war where it is all against the common working man	0
1	The timeline seems to spell out, I fell out with your best friend's fiancee and was being such a whiny cow that I felt you slipping away... oh look, I'm preggers - gotcha!	And how do you know this?	0
1	Married and have a lot of sex, especially for my level of libido so I'm good there.	Illumunati confirmed.	0
1	Don't these people always also say sex work is real work?	***They are doing their work why are you going to them?***    Feminist Logic	0
1	An open marriage during Covid?  Talk about living dangerously . . .	I still have an open marriage during covid, same as I'm still bisexual during covid.  I've not in-person met any other partner in nearly two years, to be fair.	0
1	ugh, I saw that post also. I didn't even click the link. Fucking idiotic.	Tried reporting it as misinformation, no dice. That sub has a seriously demented agenda.	0
1	I doubted it was real when OP says they’ve never been on reddit then immediately says they were using a throwaway. If you’ve never used reddit you wouldn’t need a throwaway?!	The prompt to post on some of these subs mentions rules for using throwaways so that isn’t necessarily 100% proof	0
1	Sex. When you don't have to pay for it, it's the best.	Beat me to it. I guess you came before me.	0
1	The UCMJ is in addition to, not in exclusion from, the rest of US law. I don’t think anybody would credibly say servicemembers are not subject to non-UCMJ laws.	Except.. They usually aren't. Crimes by military face military prosecution. They even have military prisons.  https://www.findlaw.com/military/criminal-law/civilian-criminal-law-military-personnel.html	0
1	The other thing is 1/6 pregnancies end in miscarriage so you have a ~17% chance of it not even making it to term.	So you're wishing miscarriage on her?	0
1	Oh lord, I'm dying. 🤣   Lemme guess, her vagg is like throwing a sausage down a hallway after that.	More like flying a 747 through the Grand Canyon.	0
1	My favourite was the trans woman who started posting topless pics every day after starting hormone therapy to see when they’d get censored. The page was called, “Do I have boobs yet?”	that's a fucking great idea lmao	0
1	How am I a transphobe? I know people who are trans, but still recognize the fact that they were born biologically a male or a female. For medical purposes they still put down their biological gender that they're born with.	It's the no binary that gets to me.	0
1	Could it be thay there is nothing funny about having sex in dead ernest.	Who's Earnest, how'd he die, why am I inside him, and who am I having sex with?	0
1	No, you were not.  Studies belie that statement.  Adult males who were circumcised mostly notice NO DIFFERENCE.  Stop worrying about that.	Yes he was. He's a victim of male genital mutilation which is child abuse and here you are telling him what to feel. How low can you go? Just disgusting behaviour. Have some respect.	0
1	No, I want you to prove that people with social skills reproduce.    Because arranged marriages and child marriages are still a thing.	Arranged marriages are arranged by parents and are you implying by the child marriage thing betrothal-as-children or forcibly marrying a little girl when you're an adult male	0
1	What if I want children?	You can have children without sex.	0
1	By fifth grade my classmates were calling me gay. When I asked the sister watching our phys Ed class what gay meant she told me it meant happy. I don't see anything wrong with that.	And she also didn't lie to you either which is the best thing about this. Since historical meaning of the word and name gay is happy.	0
1	LMAO! Just fell out of my chair 🪑	Walls don’t work because ladders exist. What if some of your own people are in a cult and wish to do you harm?	0
1	Somewhat, actually. I have a strong preference for transgender men.	So you want someone to hurt himself by cut off his body parts, and then poison his body with hormones his body will fight off, to feel attracted to them?  That's one is sick as well, mate!	0
1	Good! These men should not marry!	I hope there's some kind of petition women can use as a list to check potential husbands against later on- if he signed this, he's out.	0
1	God I hate this TwoX Chromosomes sub. And they've banned me for calling out their shit	I was banned for the most ridiculously tame comment, after commenting positive things about women's rights for weeks! Just took issue when a comment called for actual male genocide, and then got banned for calling it out.	0
1	Playing "find the feminazi" is about as easy as "find the vegan"  Found the feminazi btw.	Comparing a feminist to a nazi just because they made a sound argument about abortion seems childish. Do you have an argument or claim you’d like to make?	0
1	you must not know what a loving relationship is then. obviously he cares and obviously it‘s his responsibility too, just as his responsibilities and problems are also mine. i am not 12 anymore.	Yeah. It's his responsibility when you get married. It's not his responsibility to move in his girlfriend of barely 2 months.	0
1	What does that even mean. Can children consent to sex than? Can 5 year olds drive? Can 12 year olds smile crack? This is such broad statement it can be interpreted in a million fucking ways.	I can assure you, rational people would not interpret that statement in any of those ways. Moreso, that the entire world does not need to be made child-proof in OP's personal definition of what "child-proofing" looks like. It ain't that deep.	0
1	Hot Shots!	Especially Part Deux	0
1	I love how she’s fine not being comfortable around the shady boyfriend, but OP is a major asshole for expressing doubts about the fiancés friend AND boyfriend. Honey if you don’t like being near him, time to lay down rules.	Also the fact that she doesnt like being around him yet lets him into their home and lets him "borrow" her SO's stuff	0
1	As a trans woman who finds her pronouns to be VERY important, NO, I do not.	Please call me Helicopter/HelicopterSelf.  I'd like to be adressed like that profesionnaly too.  Can it be written on my business card?	0
1	I just feel like people who think others should follow these standards of how they refer to their own children is such a tiny percentage of people they aren't worth worrying about	Well, the question was geared towards that very small percentage of people because id really like to pick their brains about it.	0
1	You would still complain, saying that the character only trait and reason for creation was to be a queer character	Of course, especially if there was no storyline behind it. For example, Calvin Ellis was Black Superman. The storyline absolutely sucked. They used race to be a substitute for an actual storyline.	0
1	Are you satire or real?  &gt;I run an LGBT+ zoom support group.   Never mind.	Yes, yes, much worse to provide free services for others than to run interference for murderers.	0
1	Do you actually WANT kids or do you just feel like the choice is being taken away from you?	Also, would you still want kids if you only had financial support?	0
1	Not sure which one is oldest, but there have been more than a dozen rewrites. I would think a pre-KJV is what you are looking for. Probably the Constantine version. It has 7-8 more books than the KJV iirc.	Thanks!!	0
1	You know who else does math? Communists and college know-it-alls!	Goddam commies!	0
1	jUsT VotE!	If you had in 2016 Roe v Wade wouldn't be overturned next year.  So yea... Vote...	0
1	I have yet to play RDR2, but didn’t a lot of people actually find it legitimately lacklustre?	You should try it, man. Game is amazing. My only complaint would be that it is dangerously close to sim territory. I love being an outlaw, but all the upkeep stuff can get a bit tedious after a while.	0
1	Depends. Is the child dying? Then I lie.  IF THE KID IS JUST ASKING BECAUSE then i tell the truth	This is what I would do as well.	0
1	Yeah I suppose there are exceptions like calling yourself a Nazi, but I feel its rather unfair that some religious people are just like 'atheist' hell no and run away	Eh. Saves me the trouble of telling them to take a hike when they inevitably start behaving holier than thou.	0
1	J&amp;J vaccine has reached 1-3% effectiveness(the others aren't far behind), while natural immunity is near 100%. Which is acceptable to these experts, and which is not?  The better question is, which one makes them **money**.	You have a source for that, by chance?  That’s a pretty big deal if the vaccines are essentially useless.	0
1	Yeah, I watched it happen on the night of the election. I watched all the votes instantly appear after they "stopped voting". But I guess you're gonna say that my eyes aren't as reliable of a source as the communist mainstream media, right?	Do you know how mail in ballots work?	0
1	There is no fairness in public policy though. I pay into the welfare program but thankfully never used it so should i march to my local senator and say wtf when i see someone using food stamps and wearing jordans?	Welfare programs are to benefit the poorest in our society, and you are almost certainly better off than them. The same cannot be said for student loans.	0
1	Dude… he’s a Nazi. This isn’t wrongthink.. HES A FUCKING NAZI. His opinion is shit	Yet you can't prove this statement wrong, lol	1
1	I am from Poland	Formal complaint and review on Znanylekarz. Also, what an asshole :/	0
1	One day when Yeshua returns we will be like Him, until them we are human and not spirit beings.  We will be proper sons and daughters of GOD in the Spirit realm.	Thank you!!	0
1	They are ignoring the fact that the bible allows abortion in this case. In the Torah, it's required.  I'm not sure if jewish women get a religious exemption in regards to restrictive abortion law, but I'm sure the christians would find a way to stop that.	Why can’t abortion also be a part of Gods plan?	0
1	Now do Gaetz.	Ok. That's cool too. I'd just prefer to go after murderers first over those with bad ideas.	0
1	[Is WW3 About to Start?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvjmC--UAvk)  short summary: No. There will be economic and cyber warfare as well as proxy wars between the super powers and there might very well be internal unrest within those countries.	>short summary: the cold war never ended. There ~~will be~~ are economic and cyber warfare as well as proxy wars between the super powers and there might very well be internal unrest within those countries.	0
1	&gt;Colorless green ideas sleep furiously."  Chomsky?	Ah, but why are they colourless?	0
1	Not so in socialist Norway.  There everyone get's welfare or a living wage so there is little or no child support.	>Not so in socialist Norway.  norway inst socialist	0
1	Yeah, many Orthodox oppose Ecumenism.	That’s because we view our Church as the true Church and all schisms thereafter as a farther separation from the truth. Why would we want ecumenism with heretics?	0
1	Your first sentence was in Jar Jar Binks' voice, in my head.  Like God, Jar Jar Binks doesn't exist in reality and shouldn't have been created as a fictional character.	I am fond of the Jar Jar Binks as a Sith Lord meme.	0
1	YHWH lost control in Chapter One when Eve outsmarted him.	I have no idea what YHWH means	0
1	Any symbols of communism should be banned from display in public settings.	Yeah! And symbols of religion.	0
1	Imagine telling Nazis to stop persecuting jews	A little extreme my guy	0
1	My last church had three Esthers. All are older than 60. My current church has three Ladies name Lois. All are older than 45. But last week I met another Lois who is in her 20s.	I actually know a 12 year old Ester!	0
1	WHAT DO YOI MEAN THE PRESIDENT ISNT MAGIC! ALL WE NEED TO VOTE IN ANOTHER CORPORATE BOUGHT WHITE GUY AGAIN! SOMEONE WILL SAVE US!   … yeah… keep waiting bud.	A defeatist caps lock whataboutist meltdown? Must be Friday.   I'm sure this will successfully distract from Republican hypocrisy and make everyone blame the other party instead.	0
1	because men have literally been killing women for centuries and the “kill all men” was made as a JOKE in retaliation to blatant misogyny. the term femicide exists for a reason. when you say “kill all women” you’re not joking.	Yes, the term femicide exists because nobody cares about the targeted murder of men.	0
1	Haven't watched any Jewish movies.	Not even Jewish movies, I saw it in the original X-Men movie from 2000  as a kid and it kinda just stuck with me	0
1	Catholics attacking scientists and dragging us into the dark ages? No way.	History repeating itself - -	0
1	You forgot the Nazi part lmao	I was banned from r/communism for participating in r/pewdiepiesubmissions as they don't accept "Nazi sympathizers". I'm an economic leftist myself, but that's just... you know... not a good look.	0
1	They speak both languages in their prayers? I guess that would be a better question for a Jew	Jews use Hebrew and Aramaic. Our prayer for the dead is in Aramaic, most others in Hebrew. You can pray in any language though, although it's considered better to pay in Hebrew since not everything can be translated into every language.	0
1	Hardly a straw man, I think the argument speaks for itself. And yeah I’m sure there are *soo* many ethnically Jewish Christians on the sub, I’ll bet you see this kind of thing all the time. /s	Your argument is at most that it's hypocritical.  And having spent over a decade here, you might be surprised at the people that have come through.	1
1	Not in English at least. "The Ukraine" implies it's a region within a country. Like "the southeast (of the US)". But it's a sovereign nation. You wouldn't say "The Germany".	The United States of America	0
1	I'm torn. Do I go with OPs Mother or Putin...	That’s a low blow my guy	0
1	I’m rooting for Ukraine and am surprised at their resilience against a superpower, but the outlook seems grim when you look at the numbers.	Russia hasn't been a superpower since the days of the Soviet union.  France and the UK alone have a stronger military.	0
1	You just openly said that no matter the democrats ran would be painted as a socialist... so I really dont see the disadvantage of just running a socialist....?	The difference is how believable it would be. I can call Bezos a socialist but most people just won’t believe it.	0
1	Maybe NK will invade Taiwan.	They would lose. Badly.	0
1	That’s kinda the point of learning about the Holocaust tho: it happened, and if we don’t actively work to prevent it, it can happen again. Hell on Earth is real, and there’s never a guarantee you won’t see it tomorrow.	Not what I’m saying. The Holocaust was a factual thing. It happened.   Nobody is threatening children that they’ll be sent to concentration camps if they’ve been bad…. Which is essentially what the concept of hell is about.	0
1	I actually have. We are not on the path to communism. We are moving further away from capitalism but we aren’t going to stop being capitalist tell all of us are long dead  Also if you hate it so much why don’t you move	You are dreaming!	0
1	cringe post, people are leaving their families in safety and going back willingly to defend their land, even ukrainians living in poland are quitting their jobs and going home to fight  sub has been terrible since russia invaded, just stfu pls	They're literally pulling men out of cars and forcing them to fight. Sure, some men are probably fighting willingly, but it doesn't matter because they don't have a choice. Only women do.	0
1	It's literally fact that religion brainwashes kids. I got a YT video reccomendation titles, "child asks Pope if his non-believing dead father is in Heacen". Poor fucking kid, crying and shit. Brainwashing and abusive that's all religion is.	Your father burns in fire constantly.	0

1	See above… He said he voted for Former President Obama… But the party left him with a swing towards socialism.   Today moderate Republican is a JFK democrat	Yup. This is exactly what I was talking about and I was simply providing examples of what Elon Musk believed prior.	0
1	“Let me control the text books, and I’ll control the state.” - Hitler   The school board officials are nothing more than SS enforcement officers of the state educational system. Whether they realize it or not, is up for debate.	Any school board that responds in THIS manner, by cutting the mic, and not immediately profusely apologizing for that type of thing is exactly what you say.  I agree.  I do not think we're alone, either, my friend.	0
1	Don't even whine, y'all claiming joe biden is a pedo, bet none of you will call a woman who kisses children and sniff their hair pedophiles, so don't whine about something you also contribute to	All pedo hysteria comes from misandry	0
1	Giving a workspace available to both sides of the political spectrum is just as important. ‘Weeding out’ leftist employees does not make anything better for anyone.	Agreed.  Leftists still deserve their place at the podium.	0
1	Oh man... just wait until you get to the Gospels. The stuff we actually have verifiable recorded history for... (I guess Exodus counts in that too).	>Exodus  Nope. There's literally zero archeological evidence for the Exodus. Israel's national museum recognizes this by having an empty exhibit hall dedicated to the lack of evidence for the Exodus. (See: The Bible Unearthed)	0
1	^((yelling it for the people in the back))   # STAYING JUST FRIENDS IS A LIE, DO NOT FALL FOR IT	Yup. "staying friends" just means they want to keep wasting your time trying to get back together. Leant that the hard way 😣 why do they lie so much??!? It's so annoying.	0
1	I wouldn't even class it as a conventional movie. It's more of a glimpse into hell. Hyper-realistic and nightmarish at the same time. The SS really were abhorrent.	Doesnt seem like my type of movie,even though it seems interesting	0
1	If you can't read Hebrew, I recommend the Artscroll translations with commentary.   For the New Testament look up where it says hell and Google it. It is not in the Greek Manuscripts.	Thank you!! I’ve never really been able to get a straight answer from people, so this is perfect.   A follow up question if you don’t mind: What exactly did Jesus save us from if there’s no hell?	0
1	Shouldn't fighting russia be the last resort because they have nukes	No shit, but guess what?  Russia feels the same way.  When Biden says in advance that we won’t get involved, that gives Russia a free pass to invade.  You have to keep playing the game of chicken where no one wants to make the first move.	0
1	And guess what? I couldn't give a fuck if they wore their seat belt or not, just like the jab.	Analogies aren't your strong suit, are they?	0
1	You cannot be a non genocidal Nazi, because genocide is core to the ideology. You can be a socialist who does not support genocide in any capacity. That’s the difference.	You absolutely can be a non genocidal NAZI!  To even make your statement shows a child’s understanding of WW2	0
1	the Gospel hasn't changed since the days of Enoch.   Enoch, all the prophets, YAHshua, and the Apostles all preached the same Gospel:   YAHweh has blinded the christians to the Gospel of the COMING KINGDOM OF YAHWEH.	I think we may have a disconnect at this point. Tell me, what is the message of the Gospel? This would help us better understand where each other is coming from	1
1	Jeans Trasher, Hemorrhoid Mary (like Typhoid Mary).    That's why you'll sometimes see it written as JHTM(lTM).  It also has something to do with Invader Zim, but that part isn't clear.	I see Invader Zim is a cancelled Nickelodeon show, but googling “JTHM(ITM),” “Jean trasher,” or “haemorrhoid Mary,” bring up literally nothing. What is it/are they?	0
1	Do any of you wonder why America is finding Israel so willingly or care, because if America is your concern this should be worrying.	The same reason America spends money in Europe, in East Asia, Australia etc. to protect its interests.	0
1	A grifter who preys on people by spewing prosperity pablum from the pulpit. Go to CARM.org, type in “Joyce Meyer” and your eyes will be opened by what you find.	Wow, great link. Hard to believe she could actually say  that Jesus stopped being the Son of God, went to hell and became sin, and if you don't belive it you cannot be saved. What heresy.	0
1	As a Hebrew speaker, I'm not sure that it does.	What does Adonai mean?	0
1	How does not believing the original Torah was preserved mean I don't follow the same faith as Abraham?	Because it’s a historical fact that Israel since it’s beginning offered animal sacrifices. Do you believe Israel was “corrupted” since the beginning?  There was not a single religion in the ancient near East that DIDNT have animal sacrifice.	0
1	When the Leninist-supporting GOP becomes the government, who is stopping them then?	When libertarians destroy our infrastructure, public works, and social safety nets, who is stopping them?	0

1	Bruh did you really say extreme and then use the word genocide to describe abortion...	It's not wrong, what else would you call it?	0
1	It’s not a kid or a baby. It’s still inside a woman. Your comparison to Nazis is insulting to those who actually died at the hands of tyranny.	If we're being accurate then they are all called "offspring". However, if you ask someone if they have any children/kids, everyone knows you are referring to offspring of any age. I am using the words like that.	0
1	We have a seven day week.  That proves God because he set it up as seven days in Genesis.	“This hole fits me perfectly,” said the puddle.	0
1	ESH - Do you see the irony in butting in to someone else's business in order to tell them to mind their own business?	I was thinking this too.	0
1	You know damn well he didn’t even know Ukraine was a country before all this. Probably can’t even find it on a map!	Except for his son's employment with Burisma. He knows about Ukraine alrighty.	0
1	Might sound a bit nitpicky but I have a pet peeve with whenever I hear people saying this.  There is no **wanting** superiority. It's there, and in every regard - how this Ukraine thing is being treated is just another example it.	I agree	0
1	The original was GREAT ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McA6L43lW7o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McA6L43lW7o) and the oh no part is at 0:57)  As usual, tiktok ruins everything of value	So stupid that you let a song being in a social media post "ruin it" for you lmao. Literally makes 0 sense, just get off TikTok and think for yourself.	0
1	I can't unhear the "WhAt wOuLd wE dO WiThOut MEN".	I mean you can’t fault the men who build & maintain shit coz that’s actually useful but the guys who just work in offices and stuff are just taking up space in most cases	0
1	WELCOME TO MY WORLD LOLOL	This is my last straw. I’m moving out. This is my thirteenth reason	0
1	It wasn't in the Christian viewpoint initially. It was the orthodox or historic Jewish aspect. And because Jesus was a Jew it only made sense to adopt the ancient Jewish interpretation.	This is not correct.	0
1	Isn’t this a copypaste from the SCUM manifesto?	I thought so as well lmao, "copypasta' immediately sprung to mind	0
1	So if the dems changed their names to the constitutional republicans...	The. The Republican Party might just be lost.  So we should maintain ourselves as constitutional republicans first	0
1	OP don’t you understand? The new HOT thing is WAR!! Covid gets to take a backseat now that the journos have a far more tragic and horrendous thing to report on for their own financial gain!	The Ukrainian flag is the new virtue signal.	0
1	Tell that to the Ukrainian women who get raped by Russians and must carry their babies.	I know it’s hard for them, but there is nothing their children did to deserve death. They’re human beings, just like the rest of us, and therefore entitled to the same rights.	0
1	I asked a christian if hitler could have made it into heaven, they straight up said yeah he could - if he accepted jesus and was sorry for his sins he would be forgiven.	Yeah i'll take hell over hypocrisy	0
1	Bruh incels exist. It’s not a satire thing sadly	Thank you!	0
1	lmao you dont know the fricking news of Ukrainian men of age 18-60 stopped and sent to fight, and women sent away to safe places ?  lol I'm dead after seeing your comment xD	I did, it Still doesn’t mean women were involved in making that decision   The government made that decision, you can blame the government but you instead grasp at straws to blame women xD	0
1	YWNBTA for talking about it.  It's a communal space though - everyone needs to agree.  Start with the places where it clearly doesn't make sense (doorstops, lol).  That milk carton with a hole in it could be for watering plants.	i assumed the milk carton was next to the window so the water would evaporate an act as a humidifier?	0
1	But are those Israeli women in combat units like the men, or support units?	They are in combat units , they fight good and are actually serving their country proudly as women , they're hot as hell too.	0
1	How sure are you? Give source pls? I heard BOTH! options of only fard vs all of them	Sunnah is optional anyways. Of course it is sufficient to just make up the fardh	0

1	Converting to Judaism can be a years-long process. One need not be completely fluent in Hebrew to practice Judaism, but one does need to be conversant enough with important terminology to understand the commandments that they are supposed to uphold.	Do you think you could tell me or link me to somewhere I can learn the terminology?	0
1	To be fair, Hitler's birthday is 4/20 so a lot of people will ha e something (or nothing) to do, I will celebrate after working that day.  Death to the Nazis, smoke weed everyday (or at least as often as possible)  All races are good  All racists are bad	I really wish I could enjoy weed more. I just end up hyperventilating for a few hours until it wears off.	0

1	But all the leaches on welfare don't need the jab?  You know why the homeless don't have an issue with the beer flu?  They don't have televisions....	Democrats might lose a lot of votes if they did that.	0
1	Because this is very much socialism.	being a dummy who doesnt like talking to his coworkers is socialism???	0
1	In fairness it also meant destroying the Russian Orthodox Church as that institution was critical for keeping the Czars and their friends in power.	That basically ended up being a byproduct of taking out the hierarchy, not the goal though.	0
1	Classic Marxist no?	Money for me but not for thee	0
1	That's how capitalism works. If it's cheaper to do or make something somewhere else, companies will.	>That's how capitalism works. If it's cheaper to do or make something somewhere else, companies will.   There's a competing concept, "national security." Depending on foreign sources for strategic material weakens national security.	0
1	You know, that's probably what Hitler thought too. Except for white blooded aryans. That's also what zionists think. Be careful in how you believe yourself better than others, and see how others believe the same.	Except that ANYONE can become a Muslim	0
1	You are sure? For someone who wants to have their mind changed, you sure are not taking in new data very well. This is from the pew research center, which is unbiased.	I am saying your politically biased survey does not change my mind. I am not saying that my mind can not be changed.	0
1	This has nothing to due with Marxism. Stop derailing.	It's Neo-Marxism, to be specific. Marx confined his teaching to economics and social classes. Later Theorists combined his teachings with Post-Modernism to apply his teachings to many other areas of society.	0
1	Nazism isn't a form of religion. It's a political party (at least started as such) that consisted of almost exclusively extremist Christians. So yep, it's definitely their fault. No excuse for their behaviour.	Nazism is an idea. Religion is an idea.  Nazism has doctrines and tenets, religion has doctrines and tenets.  > It's a political party (at least started as such)   Wrong. The political party is called NSDAP.	0
1	wat? people are saying salt does nothing lol. are you joking?	That's predominantly because they're ignorant of how Holy water is created.	0

We have these awesome meme makers that make the coolest cartoons you've ever seen, and they've been banned from all the other platforms.”  Lmao wtf	>We have these awesome meme makers that make the coolest cartoons you've ever seen  Jesus, that is the most boomer sentence I've ever heard.	0

1	Normally posts with under 1000 upvotes think joe lost.  Incidentally they're almost always flaired only too	It's sad how many conservatives have been duped into believing a total fantasy. Pitiful, really	0
1	Literally not better, since the other side was helping us to equalize SS and he ruined that.	So if one party is coming at you with a knife and the other a nuclear warhead, the knife isn't 'better?' Give me a break.	0
1	IKR!!	Completely unbelievable	0
1	Is there an official list or dictionary if there “dog whistle” tropes. I ask because “upscale liberal” = Jew is not one I’ve ever heard of.	You’ve never heard of the conspiracy theory that Jews control the media?	0
1	The only thing I didn't like is how they used Israel as such a major location and plot device.	They probably were in kahoots with israel to make the movie more popular	0
1	I didn't bring up jewish people I all is said was I'd you dont know how it feels then you should argue and opinion that doent have a leg to stand on.	You brought it up when you tried to dismiss his opinion but calling him just a cis white man and that blew up in your face. Then you went on to continue the argument/comparison.	0
1	In a very stretched sense Hitler was surprisingly humane besides the whole causing world war 2 and killing millions of people thing	Still was evil as fuk tho	0
1	Nope. Abraham is plausible and would live around 1700BCE. IIRC oldest parts of the Bible are dated at 1300BCE so 400 years of spoken propagation is not impossible.	Far Far more areas in the world got flooded after the most recent ice age ended.  Significant past areas which were once inhabited are now under water.	0
1	Yeah and wash it down with this juicy nugget 2thes 2:11"For this reason God sends them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie".  Yahweh is in the business of intentionally deceiving and overriding the ever so sacred human free will.	And yet...  Somehow Satan is the 'father of lies', without being documented as telling a single lie.  ....somebody projecting.	0
1	I mean joe Biden has like 4 kids, so	Dang. See what you did there.	0
1	Jewishness is an ethnoreligious designation. Anti-semitism is racialized hatred of Jews.   Source: I am a Jew	But wasn’t it the Nazi’s who said that the Jewish were a race? I’m confused.	0
1	With my conservative brother, the word communism is used interchangeably with socialism, and sometimes together as in "that commie socialist Biden."	Communism and socialism are interchangeable but Biden is neither.	0
1	Democrats=\=left  They're a right wing party that supports liberal idpol.	The democrats received their votes from the left, though. The votes that won them the house, senate, and presidency	0
1	I can't confirm or deny whether God prescribed sacrificing animals as atonement for sins or a "day of atonement" as I do not believe the original Torah was preserved so I don't know what teaching they've added, subtracted, or modified.	Well, that just goes to show you reject the faith of Abraham.	0
1	The communist manifesto?	Mao & Stalin weren't Marxists.  Mao even wrote his own book.	0
1	This cross just seems to be exonerating KR even more…	Yeah, how does the jury look at any of these videos and not see self defense?	0
1	Instead of reading everything in English and getting your own understanding 2nd hand, Why don’t you talk to a local Rabbi or better yet, study the original Hebrew and Aramaic for yourself?  Then you can make an informed decision based upon fact.	What?	0
1	You’re welcome!    A final thought: This talk from [Seraphim Rose](https://youtu.be/fJRVJwnhVzI) might be helpful &amp; enjoyable for you. It’s around an hour and half, all concerning the fall of Adam &amp; Eve.	I think it might be!   I can’t overstate my appreciation for how walking into a forum like this with a contradictory viewpoint was received. There are definitely less than civil spiritual followers out there on the internet!	0
1	Invading Czechoslovakia after expressly promising not to.	Should have made him pinky promise😔	0
1	The President of Ukraine should jump on the first plane and fly to the heart of Europe, break in the doors and demand Ukraine join NATO NOW and live to stream it so people of Earth see it.	> fly to the heart of Europe  That might not be the best optics. It could be viewed as them abandoning Ukraine to seek refuge elsewhere. After all, demanding to join Nato doesnt have to be in person.	0
1	It unreal that some people still want to use the Holocaust to support this nonsense.	There’s some people with national media attention who think the holocaust was just “white people killing white people”… not genocide	0
1	I am saying that Hitler bears responsibility for WW2. This is not a very controversial take.	That's not the question I asked  though. The Nazis are causally responsible for the Soviets being in Poland in  the first place. Saying that they are morally responsible for Soviet actions after the reconquest of Poland in 1944 is outrageous.	0
1	It really is just their corrupt goverments. In Jordan, I would see the Israeli flag on dumpsters, donkeys, the ground, and as welcome mats to wipe your feet on.	My theory is Jordan was  Created to make a zone so the Citizens of like Saudi, Syria, Iraq can't get to Israel. Which is probably why the US has bases all over the Jordan border	0

1	https://m.jpost.com/diaspora/antisemitism/article-706727/amp  here’s a link including a quote by him calling himself a socialist, maybe i got the two confused, but he said it himself.	No shit? And they’re still trying to flip it??	0
1	It wasn't in the Christian viewpoint initially. It was the orthodox or historic Jewish aspect. And because Jesus was a Jew it only made sense to adopt the ancient Jewish interpretation.	Huh ?  In Jewish reading/tradition  the homosexual aspect is not emphasised or stressed like in Christianity/Islam	0
1	I would wager a (sad) guess that the 34% of Democrats who want him impeached think he's not being extreme enough with forcing through the socialist agenda.	I suspect it's the "he promised to cancel our college debts!" crowd.	0
1	The [current proposal](https://www.rollcall.com/2021/10/27/wyden-details-proposed-tax-on-billionaires-unrealized-gains/) only includes those with over $1 billion in assets. It would not apply to the "average joe".	For now but it always trickles down to the rest of us	0
1	&gt; The party all about slavery just embraced socialism  If you want, you can say socialism is just state slavery.	Bet you’ll be crying for it when you’re 65. And learned to read from state sanctioned education.  Is that slavery? No. It’s for the common good.	0

1	shop.ocasiocortez.com  She's selling that catchphrase on sweatshirts for $58  Wonder what the dress will go for once it's posted on her swag website.   Boy,  for a socialist she sure has a capitalist mindset.	It’s called fundraising. It’s a hell of a lot less corrupt than lobbying.	0
1	Ehhh...yeah socialism wants to achieve a communism state (communism).	Not necessarily. Social-democrats and classical socialists do not believe in socialism as mean to a end - that is communism -, they don't even believe in class struggle.	0
1	Oh I’m sure it is 🤣  “WoUlD pUTiN iNvADe on 3/24/2022??? Source please??”  Dumbass	Lol, that's not what I asked a source for. The poster said Trump was threatening to withdraw from NATO at Putins request. That's what I wanted a source for.	0
1	Okay. I find most people are unfamiliar with Judaism generally, so I assumed that was why you thought I was talking about dog training.	To clarify I was saying you were comparing raising a person to training a dog and that's what my issue is.	0

1	IF U LOVE HER, treat her like a queen  and as Messiah loved the church and gave himself for it. EPH 5:21-33  IF U cannot do that U obviously do not love her, let her go.	This is batshit insane advice. Did you read the actual post? You can love someone and still realize the relationship isn’t healthy and leave, which is what OP should do	0
1	Because they don't want people thinking communism is bad hence what they're trying to spin the narrative these protests are about covid	Ding ding we have a winner! You are exactly right.	0
1	In the Soviet Union everyone you didn't like got made up charges like this then executed for those crimes.	This isn't true. It's cold war propaganda, you can read all the declassified documents now from that period.	0

1	Just curious, how far would russia need to encroach on the rest of the world before you would suggest intervening?	At an absolute minimum, a member of nato. Ukraine has been a part of Russia for most of its history, it sucks for them but zero Americans ought to die over this.	0
1	There is no showdown.  Manchin holds all the power right now.  And he is the only thing stopping us from sliding into a socialist nightmare.

There’s just some things you don’t do when you are supposedly on the same time...	0

1	I’ll give you one better. How does your chance of dying from Covid decrease by getting a jab? From 0.3% to 0.1%, or you go from 99.7% chance of survival to 99.9%. But the media will tell you, that you are 3 times better protected by getting jabbed.	I hear what you’re saying, but there are 350 million people in this country, so that .2% is 700,000 extra lives saved if the whole country eventually gets infected.	0

1	In these drawings the suffragettes are all very skinny, with coily hair and Jewish coded facial features. Now men portray us as fat with colored hair and hairy armpits. 🤔	That's because back then, being "fat" meant you had more than enough to eat.  Nowadays, it's pretty much the opposite (unless on the extreme end, of course).	0

Be careful in how you believe yourself better than others, and see how others believe the same.	Well, Hitler was a kafir himself, and didn’t follow Islam. If he had, he wouldn’t have committed such atrocities. Yet another example of kuffar being inferior	0

1	Here is all you need to know. If the Israelis put down their weapons and stopped fighting they would be pushed into the ocean and massacred. If the Palestinians put down their weapons there would be peace.	Like Ben Shapiro has said, if Juarez launched 10,000 rockets into El Paso the US flag would be flying in Mexico City within 48 hours.	0

The Biden administration is pushing the vaccines because it's the logical thing to do.	0
1	I can describe DRUMPF as a Nazi Mobnster.  At least Biden got legitimately elected by the people.	He should be jailed for crimes against humanity. How many people died that were bullied into taking the ineffective vaccine? The truth will never come out.	0

1	Shouldn't fighting russia be the last resort because they have nukes	If Russia uses a nuke, their country is done, period, forever. Is Putin literally suicidal? I don't think so.	0
1	I'm assuming because Hitler wasn't appointed chancellor until 10 years later, which the point would be Trump doesn't have 10 years.	It took Hitler 10 years to build up the  notoriety and party members to take over the country. Trump already has the notoriety and party apparatus.	0
1	“This is cap I will burn your house down with the Jews.”  Sounds like some nazi shit to me	Oh I thought they were saying they were going to team up with the Jews to burn down the house	0
1	No, the situations are nothing alike.  The State of Israel didn't exist 100 years ago, but Palestine has always been Jewish land.	The Kingdom of Israel was a thing you know..   This whole "Israel didn't exist until" thing is taken from a worldview which ignores the vast majority of world history.	1

1	What did you see? I find it incredible that you appear to be labeling Trump a fascist. Do you even know what a fascist is?	[Here's Umberto Eco's 14 properties of a fascist ideology from his essay Ur-Fascism.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Definitions_of_fascism#Umberto_Eco)  If you don't see the *blindingly* obvious similarities, you're being willfully ignorant.	0

1	It’s become an umbrella covering the anti-SJW’s, incels, conservatives, and others. All of them are against various aspects of social justice and progressives albeit different parts of it and for different reasons.	But that is everyone. Conservatives, liberals, young people or old people. So in the end it would just mean wrongthink basically. I mean most SJWs would fall under the term as well.	0
1	Lmao you’re in a thread dissing progressives, so guessing LibSoc.   FOH socialist, braindead ideology.	Give a description in your own words, not a label. I'm looking to see how well you understand it, not just if you can google "progressivism".	0

Aerosmith’s cover is also pretty good	0
1	This. Shapiro put it best, it's a case of perceived mutual self-defense, so it comes down to whose lawyer can make the best case for intent.	I watched that video. That's not what Shapiro said, at all.  He said the left couldn't use it to push a narrative, because everyone would agree what those guys did was fucked up. You can only push a narrative if someone pushes back.	0

1	Are you completely ignorant? First, there is no official count so there’s that. Further, from all accounts the number of dead Ukrainians is about an even split make to female.	Whered you read that?

1	War communism was never intended to be a permanent system for the soviet union, it was barely even a system at all just a set of ad hoc policies enacted to keep the Bolsheviks in power and win the war.	The instructions for the decree of October 26, 1917, state the following:   > The right of private ownership of land is cancelled **forever**. Land may not be bought, sold, leased or hired, nor expropriated by any means whatsoever.	0

1	Jealously soaking people who made better decisions is the whole point. Go to any socialist subreddit - they’re filled with the most bitter, petty and vindictive people you’ll ever meet (and none of them are starving).	Yes I know,  they banned me asking a simple question.  They don’t like relevant questions that don’t fit whatever their narrative is.  Smh.	0

1	Oh jeez...the kids?  Has Deutsche Bank forgiven Trump's loan?  I get Trump tried to build conspiracies to commit crimes, but he's also woefully incompetent and just because he tried something doesn't mean there was agreement from anyone else.	Username checks out.  There were shenanigans going on with that appointment. It walks like a duck, quacks like a duck, it’s a duck.	0
1	all of Ukraine are Cossacks?	No, like any other nation its a mix of different peoples and religions. Even the name Ukraine itself means roughly "borderland" bc of its history of being the the borders of many empires. Most recent Russia, Poland-Lithuania and Austria-Hungary.	0
1	&gt; This is a horrible system because if everyone took that 12% and put it into an index fund, they'd be far better off than getting a small SS check.

1	Forgive my confusion - now I'm curious as to how I was unclear. I did say that every American war after WW2 has been illegal and unjustified, and I did briefly state why I believe our participation in WW2 was neither.	You were not unclear. ‘Or are you forgetting you history classes?’ was just needlessly dickish. It was also a selective response. That’s fine, just doesn’t make me want to continue the exchange.	0

Otherwise, I’ve already decided to vote independent   Inb4 tHrOwInG uR vOtE	Consider literally every other important decision in front of our nation, such as healthcare, voting rights, civil rights, etc instead of how you can personally benefit financially	0
1	I would go back to 1963 and live on Hydra with Leonard Cohen and the hippies, just smoking pot, writing music and poetry and makin' looooove.	Same year that the Beatle's had there American tour	0

1	Joseph Rosenbaum, the BLM protestor who instigated the entire incident by attacking Rittenhouse, had previously been convicted of 11 counts of child molestation of boys between 9-11 years old.	Thats great. I don't see how that pertains to what we were talking about	0
1	My dude, you have **Quality**. Not *QUANTITY*.   Do your friends have dogs? Make them groomsmen? Jkjk  NTA	Or ring bearers. I love YouTube videos of doggy ring bearers!	0
1	That's only capitalism speaking out of you. Have you ever considered, that it's logically impossible that everything keeps growing forever in a universe of limited resources?	I didn't know capitalism was around in ancient Greece and Rome when stoicism was found because that's where I got it from. But sure keep making excuses	0
1	FWIW, Hungary did just announce their unwillingness to allow weapons to pass through to Ukraine.	Wait, how is that possible? Hungary is a member of NATO.	0
1	YTA. Playing to the lowest common denominator is a great strategy. How did you manage to persuade your mother to "disrespect" your SIL by having her wear something she likes? Call it what it is: you believe that if your mother wears it, she will shame you.	Bot? All you did was copy another posters comment and replied to mines with it lol	0

1	YTA just because she is being raised Jewish doesn’t mean her catholic family members can’t include her in their celebrations. I don’t understand the reasoning for the hard line here from you and your wife.	it is their choice and the catholic family should accept that and not push op to summit to what they want so he is NTA they should respect his wishes and not push op and his family to participate in something they don't want to	0
1	You are both making Hitler out to be way more of a rational actor than he was.	True, he spent most of the war doing heroin and cocaine on a daily basis.	0
1	Washington west of the Cascades.  Oregon has enough meth and Nazis on the east side of the state too.	Right - this is an urban vs rural situation not a state one. Colorado has its fair share of gun crazies. And California has a ton of right wing anti-vax Trump supporters.	0
1	wut 😭	Read your title bro	0
1	Moses followed the Torah. Jesus followed the Injeel. They followed what was revealed to them. It’s really not difficult to follow along with that.	What im saying is moses know he couldn't steal even before he was introduced to the 10 rules. Why Jesus didnt knew alcohol is harmful and gave it to many people including himself?	0
1	More government overreach. Let the free market fix things this isn’t communism.	Nothing says "free" market like a market where commerce is more or less overseen by five major companies. In your definition of "free" I'm sure you use China as an example often.	0
1	This is speculation but maybe Moses received revelation the same day,since we don’t know when he saw the burning bush	If you're gonna make a post about Allah speaking to a prophet you better not speculate because you're literally quoting Allah, and if you're quoting Allah you must have a valid strong source. This is really dangerous	0

1	Remember those warmongers who declared war on Hitler just because he invaded Poland ...	That worked out so well for England and France. I wonder why they didn't declare war on the USSR.	0
1	To pick an unfortunately overused historical comparison: Hitler’s first attempt didn’t work either, but his second did.	Is it really *overused* in this case? Really?  Or is it over-ignored?	0

1	The goal of socialism is communism  -Karl Marx	You fool... The sarcasm is dripping	0
1	YTA put aside religion and sexuality and you're still wrong. Feeding someone something that they've said they can't eat is a disgusting violation of trust. You were trusted to make a meal and you deceived them.	Exactly! Even if there were no other factors and the request was simply don't serve pork to this person,  OP would still be the AH!	0
1	that's what russia says. dont you understand the irony?  also, pre-1947, the palestinians werent particularly hostile, but the Israeli army took the land because they claimed historic ties. same damn thing. learn history.	They were very much hostile.	0

1	Actually all you need to do is register to vote. We’re not Nazi Germany—we don’t do national identification cards.	Yet every legal american has an id	0
1	That isn’t what any one said though, is it? No one has stated that Poland’s crimes were on the level of the Nazis or were inspired by them. We can condemn Polish war crimes and genocide of Jews all the same. I do not believe in historical revisionism.	OP argued that they are not a “clean victim”, whatever that means.  Poland’s actions had nothing to do with what Nazi Germany did, so yes, they are very much a victim.	0

1	Yea, how dare those millions of men go Europe and kill literal Nazis.  Damn them murders. What business was it of theirs./s	Plenty of soldiers were basically kids sent by their government. Yes, by killing those troops ruthlessly, you have the blood of innocent children on your hands.	0
1	You can in Ukraine. It's not *easy* to get a change in legal documentation there, but it does exist.	The point is, that it isn't a formality as filling out an online form and that's it...	0
1	Nope. Abraham is plausible and would live around 1700BCE. IIRC oldest parts of the Bible are dated at 1300BCE so 400 years of spoken propagation is not impossible.	Literally no one cares what’s real or fake from the Bible no matter what tf that book says this is not ok	0

1	Tiktok needs to be banned. It is literally destroying kids brain, it has been linked to some mental disorders kid shave developed since tiktok became a thing	> Tiktok needs to be banned.  Yes, but because it's Chinese intelligence tracking people, not the content, that is the problem.	0
1	YTA  YOUR DAUGHTER IS NOT GOING ON VACATION. Get that through your head.   Take your own advice and get over it. You're not entitled to go on these trips.	Agreed the daugther is working, my advice for the daughter   don't tell  mom or  dad anything what country she going.	0

1	Ahh, so we're back to the old, "All the democrats have to be is better than Nazis" messaging.  Let me ask again, what have the Democrats done to help teachers and the public school system in the past 40 years?	I’m not a Democrat. I just fucking hate all Republicans.	0

1	And most leftest idiots have no idea about history or what it actually means to be compared to Hitler so they believe it!	Leftist idiot is redundant, btw	0
1	YTA for sure. You called the police because a ball went into your yard! You do know they have far more important things to deal with like domestic violence and stuff. Just because you hate kids doesnt mean they wont exist. We do need a future generation	Exactly. Like, because its not an emergency line, its ok to report inexistent crimes	0
1	There is no showdown.  Manchin holds all the power right now.  And he is the only thing stopping us from sliding into a socialist nightmare.	Him and surprisingly Sinema.	0
1	No, just like in the Soviet union the party members had what ever they want it was the normal folks that waiting for bread	Which is why we must reject this tyranny and socialist agenda.	0

1	Well no wonder his daughter went no contact. Guess who else is gonna go no contact soon...   YTA and a horribly judgemental person. How do you even start describing people based on their level of 'success'? How horrible	She probably hopes the son does go NC, then he will never be around to embarrass her again.	0
1	Jfc you are insane, the low number of numbers of female homeless people is because women are offered a shit ton more help.  go away now	How do you know that? Where was my help?

1	NTA. That guy has some serious insecurity. I love your jab about 110k being middle class because I'm sure that hit him like a freight train. You're good.	That’s a good comeback because $110k in my area qualify for affordable housing program so definitely a little below middle class in some areas, unfortunately.	0
1	&gt;Hitler had a dog. And therefore, people who have dogs are literal Nazis.   This is basically what you sound like right now.	Yeah but there are limits to that. You shouldn’t use a Nazi as a source even if he’s right (he isn’t)	0
1	But remember: ***it will not happen in a single cycle!*** Consistent support of left leaning politicians is critical!

1	Should be able to follow Nicholas Sandmann’s route, and get paid bigly from all the media outlets that slandered him.	Rittenhouse's will make Sandmann's settlement look like pocket change	0

I'd suggest you make this right before you lose your son... he's not going to pick you over her.	Makes me wonder if her son was 40 and dating a 20 year old if she would see the age gap as a red flag or happy that her "sweet boy" found a young partner to have a big family with.	0
1	I am a man who was circumcised as a baby and I wonder what the big deal is.

1	Came  here for this. Not surprising at all, but it's making people FINALLY admit that getting the jab doesn't prevent you from getting OR spreading	People have been saying that this strain isn’t affected by the vaccine.

1	Your first sentence was in Jar Jar Binks' voice, in my head.  Like God, Jar Jar Binks doesn't exist in reality and shouldn't have been created as a fictional character.	Your last para makes me think that Jar Jar is proof of god's nonexistence.	0

1	&gt; which posits inate struggles between groups,  Marxism does not posiwhich posits inate struggles between groups, it created them. Divide and conquer.

1	There are still many nice things about the USA. There are many things that are wrong with it, but those things are rarely the things that Leftists think is wrong with the USA. Leftist criticisms of the USA are generally stupid.	To be fair, we got left-wingers and right-wingers and the worst are the ones who make it into the media, not the boring rational in-betweeners.  And to be fair, England has the same issue.	0

1	... go back and look at what you've agreed to. The Nazis are responsible for crimes the Soviets committed against Poles? That is manifestly ridiculous.	I am saying that Hitler bears responsibility for WW2. This is not a very controversial take.	0
1	Yes, and they are only reasonable to the Russian government.  Land for peace rarely works.  Just ask Israel.	Israel just assassinated a journalist. So I don't think I value their opinion, at this point, with regards to peace.	0

But it blows my mind that people think if you're vaxxed you can't spread covid 🤦‍♀️	0

1	wtf are you on? drugs are bad. circumcision is a jewish practice not christian...	Ease up. I'm a different person, with different life experiences and different thoughts.

1	This article is a complete mess, if anyone actually read past the headline. The argument is basically that he's anti-Semitic for saying that an anti-Semitic trope is false...	That is not remotely accurate.  He said it used to be true that Israel completely controlled America.  That is agreeing with fucking Elder Protocol propaganda.	0

1	I quit tiktok a WHILE ago what are you talking about, I'm just trying to save others	We implies that everyone has attention span issues, which quite frankly isn't true. _You_ have an attention span issue.   >save others  🤣	0
1	That’s not a flaw. It’s a feature! Or did they forget where TikTok comes from?	Chy-na!	0
1	I for one still avoid Gillette and J&amp;J products if possible.	Dollar Shave Club has good quality razors, and shaving creme.  And Right Guard makes deodorant just as good as Gillettes.	0
1	Do you actually want Ukraine to win the war, or at least not lose the war, or do you want to stick to your ideological principles. Remember, Russia is now deliberately targeting known areas and structures where they know civilians are sheltering.	Yes i want Ukraine to win this somehow. Tho i dont know if its possible. Im just disappointed they had to ban men like that.	0
1	I’m a conservative, why should we be funding Israel’s defense?   Last I checked we didn’t add a 51st star to the flag.	It’s a strong ally in a sea of shit. If you support shit, well…	0

1	Rabbis would never go for it.  They wouldn't consider whatever was instituting them in charge to be legitimate.	I've asked a few and they are open to the idea. Some were very enthusiastic.  Are you a Rabbi?	0
1	Technically the Weimar Republic. Start in the shitter, end in the shitter, technically not a crash. It was mostly precipitated by their bad response to paying off their war debt.	You mean the country that was still recovering from losing a world war? Because That definitely qualifies.	0
1	Because of Stalin of course.  I bet you have no *men's issue* that directly relates to you.	Comrade Stalin was capitalist ? wuuut   And USSR had conscription before and after him too.	0
1	SJW and woke are scapegoat terms that try to frame men's issues as part of a broader culture war. MRAs themselves have been labeled as SJW and woke as derisive insults, often by many traditionalists that are openly anti men's rights.	thank you for seeing the light !	0
1	They'll take your money, then call you a communist afterward.	And we’ll accept it as a compliment and expression of solidarity.	0
1	&gt;Exodus  Nope. There's literally zero archeological evidence for the Exodus, and even Israel's national museum recognizes this by having a completely empty exhibit hall dedicated to the lack of evidence for the Exodus. (See: The Bible Unearthed)	Wait, seriously? That’s funny :D	0
1	Putin is the last person on the planet you want to piss of.	Dictators only hold thier power because of fear.  You can keep fearing this guy. I'm not   FUCK PUTIN	0
1	I asked a christian if hitler could have made it into heaven, they straight up said yeah he could - if he accepted jesus and was sorry for his sins he would be forgiven.	Considering his alleged target victim was the people who put god on a cross and killed him for all to see, i suppose it could be argued that hitler was getting righteous vengeance or something.	0
1	The pure hate for M2F people from these female chauvinists matches the hate for the Jews shown by the Nazis.	Holy hyperbole, batman.   calm down	1
1	Have you played the drinking game to it?

1	BTW this isn't against just women. He's calling out that they're all jews as well as women (very based)	I am unclear what their religion has to do with this.	1
1	Here we go. Russia has probably already bribed everybody in the Ukrainian government they need to so they can just walk in without much of a fight.	Wouldn't this be preferable to mass bloodshed?	0
1	Velvet Revolution. The Czechs went through communism and worked hard in the late 80s to rip out that cancer. Musician Frank Zappa was good friends with the guy that's credited with pushing it all forth.	Man Frank Zappas name comes up so much with these type of things	0

1	It would not be Jesus, jesus is a mythical figure.	The premise under discussion here is precisely whether or not a real person, likely named Yeshua, of Nazareth, existed and was a preacher with a following in the area of Jerusalem. What do you mean "that's not Jesus"?	0
1	I asked a christian if hitler could have made it into heaven, they straight up said yeah he could - if he accepted jesus and was sorry for his sins he would be forgiven.	Hitler committed the only sin you can’t repent from. Straight to the wood of suicides in the 7th circle of hell for him.	0

1	correct, everything you said is correct  but not just that, we like or not we are hated by kuffars, specially christians and jews, allah mentioned it almost 1500 years ago,!and we are still witnessing it now,	Aaaaand you seriously don't see how the hate goes the other way aswell?	1

1	Be sure  you and your husband write a letter of complaint to the hospitals patient services advocate. My husband went through a consultant for a shortcut when he was rude to me in hospital.	Sad, but you're right - husband should take part in that complaint as well.	0
1	Emotional intelligence isn't sympathy, it's closer to empathy, but even that isn't quite right.  Someone low on agreeableness can have high emotional intelligence and vice versa.	If that were true, then emotional intelligence is a meaningless term, which is exactly what I submit. It's no more than a feel-good phrase, more popular among astrology thots and in "journalism" than psychological literature.	0
1	she has a therapist but honestly i think at this point therapy is like an echo chamber for her	Are you in the sessions? Are you a professional therapist? No. Seems like you just don’t agree with what the therapist is saying and you’re clutching at straws.	1

1	Remember it’s not only the individual with a cancer that’s being tested it’s also the people around him.	I also believe that even when a child has cancer and dies it could be that Allah already knew this child was gonna become a bad person so out of his love he let the child die innocent and Allah knows best.	0
1	Well, professional mental health experts disagree with you. So who the hell cares what you think? No one lol.	Not all of them.  You act like this is an established fact when it could be doing more harm than good.  Once that pee pee is whacked off there is no going back though 😂	0
1	&gt;All organic, alternative medicine, homeopathic remedies and vaccines cause autism crowd…. That’s all pretty left wing.   How is that left wing? I just haven't seen any prominent figure on the left defend those positions.	You don’t need a prominent figure to defend a position for people to take it   https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2021/11/16/party-divide-vaccination/.  At least 25% are lefties. Sure there are more righties but 25% isn’t an irrelevant number	0
1	This is just the death toll, it doesn't count serious illness, long term disabilities or "long" covid.  I could not find any numbers like this morning while working on first cup of coffee, but I'm curious	Long Covid is why I'm still ultra-cautious!  Them:  "But you probably won't die!"  Me:  "Yeah, but I still don't want my life to suck."	0

1	My kid ain’t smart enough to be an engineer.  He’s got ADHD and dyslexia. He’s setting himself up to fail.	I got ADHD and Bipolar and possible dyslexia lol.

1	Physically not, mentally it will.	Let me get this straight you think a 5yo is going to have trauma (mental damage) from some hot sauce??????	0
1	Day trip care worker. Such as accompanying people with disabilities to go shopping, doctors, movies. You can typically schedule the appointments yourself but it depends on the country and you may have to work with the opposite gender.	I’ll look into it jazakallah khair. Inshallah i find the same gender	0
1	What would be recovered from a case like this? Does emotional damage/trauma have a value?	Yes, the phrase you’ll usually see where I practice is “shock, fright, and mental anguish,” and they’re recoverable as damages. Like any other damages, you have to convince the jury you actually suffered them. That’s much easier in a case like this.	0
1	Daydreaming is a sign of mental illness, you are clearly mentally ill, get some help... No wait, I have a better solution, kys	Why would I kill my self when I can sit here and annoy little boys like you. It’s much more fun	1
1	This is just the death toll, it doesn't count serious illness, long term disabilities or "long" covid.  I could not find any numbers like this morning while working on first cup of coffee, but I'm curious	Best I could find was about a third of COVID cases were still showing some symptoms a month later in wealthy nations, half in others.  https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.11.15.21266377v1	0
1	You know that disability comes from SS tax, and that has nothing to do with financial planning, right? What should disabled people do?	…get disability insurance. Or work anyway, just because you have certain disabilities doesn’t mean there aren’t other jobs.	0
1	Teachers don't get payed enough to accommodate for that kind of shit	So you should punish the students (who have no control over their school or teachers' salaries) instead of paying the teachers more. Yeah, that totally makes sense.	0
1	If their period is so bad they can't work, they should consider it, yes.   ***No one*** is entitled to being parent, so you can save your energy on that line of thought.	All men should get vacectomys until their ready for kids since they arnt entitled to have kids right? So if women have to get hysterectomy’s instead of healthcare men should just get vacectomys	1

1	“sharing similarity in early-stage symptoms with COVID-19.” This is one hundred percent being used to scare people. Make sure they don’t know if they have COVID or Ebola, so they err on the side of caution and fear and lock themselves indoors again.	Or their way of saying they have a lot of covid despite earlier saying they’d defeated it.	0
1	So why not be a doctor? Why not own a business? Neuro science is also in demand. Too many years of schooling for your liking? Urologists make more money by being unisex and having less required years.	OBGYN are doctors.  Many doctors are also business owners (private practice), those other specialties are valid choices, but them being valid does not make OBGYN invalid.	1
1	Why should any elective surgery or any cutting and removing of body pieces happen to a baby when there is no significant (or any) benefit to it?	There are benefits. You just don't think it's worth it while others do, and that's ok.	1
1	Dentist here, this experience varies so wildly per patient it's crazy. Majority are cake walks	and then there are people like me whose oral hygiene goes to shit when mental health goes to shit and i roll in every few years like "can y'all fix these 5 gum line cavities again thx"	0
1	Yeah and I'm sure they all have autism too, take off the tin hat antivaxxer	He's not indicated once that he is against vaccines. He is against medical mandates.	0
1	My autistic son is a very happy person. He's 15 and still believes in Santa and the Tooth Fairy.  Just saying...	Good for him tbh. So much pain and suffering in the world. In a way, it's better if he's happy.	0
1	I know she’ll come around, but she’s really hurting because of it right now.	Being hurt is part of growing up. You gonna experience more. Good luck.	0
1	AFAIK as someone  that's worked at a police department and has a network of family and friends that work in law enforcement, no, they do not lol Massive liability. That's for hospital staff only.	I'm pointing out how rarely utilized these things are in most rape accusation cases	0
1	You can ask for limits on the damage it does to kids too young to understand.  Some people find solace in grieving, some weaponize it.  ENT ... OP is AC asshole, but dad needs help.    ENT = everyone needs therapy	Yeah, this is my take, too. Better judgement that simple NTA.	0
1	makes sense though. a handicapped woman can still give birth. a handicapped man is a worse or incapable provider.	Why do Women need a provider? Serious Question: Why.	1
1	Check out Pete Walker's work on Complex PTSD. He does a beautiful job describing the four.	Why is it called Fawn?	0
1	I dont understand how the court can rule that a mandate for health care workers is fine, but a mandate for everyone else is unconstitutional.	It had to do with the fact that the healthcare providers receive Medicare/Medicaid funds. That is waht allowed federal control.	0
1	Hard to draw a parallel between say polio and covid...both the diseases and their respective vaccines.	Why is that?	0
1	My answer so far is schizophrenia, why do you think strangers are laughing at you if you have no visible signs of being angry.	Idc what YOUR answer is i want THE answer. See you dont know. They laugh. It doesnt matter where i am or who it is, fate just hates me. Period. Do i need to draw u a picture?	0
1	Do you also include people with poor spelling and grammar?	My native language is not english. I expect people to at least read the body text when they comment, so in face of basic incompetency I cannot help but forgive myself for my spelling.	0

1	&gt; 67% of Americans want Medicare For All.  They should probably vote like it then.	So we should put a progressive on the ticket in West Virginia. Great.	0
1	Too be fair I'm a grade 1 klutz who can give myself a concussion with my keyboard.  I'm def prone to accidents, want to know what I don't do, take fucking pain meds, seriously. It is so easy to become hooked on them.	I am also a general klutz. You know what it taught me above all else? Pain tolerance.	0
1	The point is we shouldn’t base everything we do on emotionally charged reactions to statistical anomalies. When people like you keep pumping them up it does nothing but stoke fear, anxiety, and hysteria in unwitting individuals. You need to stop.	“[“statistical anomalies”](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7036e2.htm)  Do you work in a hospital?  Spend much time on an inpatient or ICU unit?	0
1	What if someone donates millions in healthcare for that particular disease they have???	I guess that’s a philosophical question. Is it ok to kill 5 people if you pay for 100 people’s surgery? I’d say no but I’m sure there’s other people that are ok with it.	0
1	&gt; In the brain, third stage syphilis can lead to memory problems, mood changes and dementia, resulting in the need for nursing home care.	Does it also lead to swollen putty-like head syndrome?  Because if so, we may be on to something here...	0
1	Just treat them with the same respect and support you'd offer anyone who is suffering from some mental health issues.	Insist they get counseling and medication.	0
1	It’s hard what you went through, stay strong it will get better eventually.	It won't, but I've accepted that	0
1	It's actually not better.  You have a higher rate of complications on newborns and it's better to wait until they are a toddler.  Even better would be to wait until they are an adult and can decide for themselves.	Yes, it is. Nobody would recommend waiting until you're an adult. You cannot be serious. That's extremely painful. It's best as a newborn and I'm done with this topic. Fetch is never going to happen.	0
1	They are normal, but they can be abnormal too. Your best bet would be to talk with the health care professionals tomorrow. Hope your appointment goes well!	Thank you for your response. I am so nervous in what cases are they normal?	0
1	Obscenely rare if you have a functioning brain, and do what your doctor says, but yes, if you're dumb or very very very very unlucky.	Complications of childbirth aren’t as rare as you seem to think, I did everything directed by the doctor, took Lamaze course, still had 4th degree tearing. ( still having complications from that at 59 years old, it didn’t heal right.)	1
1	To do things like cook a meal once a week or to assist my sister if she needs anything (like food brought to her, tying her shoes, bringing her medication to her) for 1 or 2 hours a week.	Ok, so it basically is being a carer, just without being paid for it. You say 1-2 hours a week but since you and your parents are all working, I bet that would go up. Even if it stayed at 1-2 hours a week, and one meal a week, he still wnbta	0
1	Or those of us with children recognize bad parenting like was on display here. Starting with classifying a 4 year old as a toddler.	> Starting with classifying a 4 year old as a toddler.  I thought that was weird, too.	0
1	I want mine to be like a fortune cookie! Give me some random words of wisdom/motivation to get me through the day because with cramps, bloating and whatnot, I sure as heck will need it	What about ones that say don't leave me on the counter used or don't flush me for my mom and sister.....	0
1	Yeah, who waits until they're completely out of a medication before getting a refill script filed by their Doctor?	People with depression and ADHD	0
1	It’s what I keep hearing but if my symptoms were the same as the I unvaxxed then what benefit did I gain?	You get virtue signal power that we don't	0
1	Sure yeah I’m five. But you are the guy that used retard as a legitimate insult so check your maturity before you come after someone else’s	You're a feminist; you're lack of maturity is already well assessed.	0
1	I do because I have one of those problems but never needed medicine	If you didn’t need medication then you don’t need an opinion either	0
1	NTA. But I think you would be if you didn’t report! Being that impaired at work is an accident waiting to happen.	I am going to talk with the General Manager today about it when I go into work	0
1	I wouldn't use the word blindly for the way I treat my healthcare decisions. But I certainly weigh the opinion of my doctor far above that of my paranoid family members on Facebook	Okay, so maybe not blindly but you must admit you don’t fully know the science or mechanics behind your medical choices.	0
1	No it's not. So tell me what I'm supposed to do when someone's kid is having a tantrum and they can't be a good parent?	Once again, being a good parent is ignoring the tantrum.  If you are unable to ignore something that bothers you, seek psychological help.  That is not normal.	0
1	Babies who are going to immediately be abandoned into a government system where they'll be emotionally neglected at best are better off not being born*   but whatever helps you convince yourself you're the hero~	You saying this doesn’t make anyone by default a hero but it does make you a fucking monster.  Others should decide if their lives are worth living, not you.	0
1	My parents were able to get an actual prescription for Ivermectin because, evidentially, it can help to eliminate/reduce inflammation caused by COVID?	Where did they get it from, 'America's Frontline Doctors'?   https://time.com/6092368/americas-frontline-doctors-covid-19-misinformation/	0
1	lmao literally proving that you’re just here to boost your own egotistical views and not to actually learn about how or why these issues arise	It really doesn’t seem you have or are capable of learning much on this topic.  But you know…..if something repeatedly doesn’t work just keep doing it right?	0
1	If you fart and sneeze at the same time, your body takes a screenshot.	I actually laughed at this. Lol	0
1	Op is saying stupidity in the sense that the patients themselves are stupid	he is saying the stupid people are the ones not getting vaccinated or worrying about covid. old people then did not have a vaccine to refuse, or a choice as to where they lived or who was put with them.	0
1	I was questioning what day you're up to on your period.	Dude.  Stop wasting your time with trolls.  Just report her and move along.  &#x200B;  She wants attention, don't waste yours on her.  The only winning move is not to play.	0
1	Are you playing retarded right now? The man who broke your seal will be satisfied	Shutcho retarded ass up	0
1	Because   It’s money.   Babies don’t have money, so they can’t pay for healthcare.   I do, so I matter.	No you don't stop trying to get attention on reddit and get a life	0
1	I don't think it's only parenting although that's one of the biggest factors. I think it's also society in general, peers, movies and TV, social media etc. All big pushers for men and boys to be "macho".	If we all had secure upbringings, we’d have no need to appear macho and the culture would die out.	0
1	As a child psychiatrist, this decision is going to lead to a huge spike in demand for my services in about 5 to 6 years. And yes, I read Freakonomics...	What are the numbers on mother's who need help after aborting their babies? I've known a few that had a pretty hard time after.	0
1	Yup, gotcha, still think it's misleading to say "I'm a doctor" *shrug*	Regardless, she never said she was a doctor. She said she studies medicine.	0
1	No, she has a sad history of mental health issues. This is why I'm choosing not to be mad at her. She's been through the worst in life.	I've been raped over 100 times I've been beaten up by most.of my partner's  I've been bullied so bad that i ended up with bpd, which lead me to all that abuse   And I never used that as an excuse to do illegal stuff	0
1	A bit more mature than calling people psychopats when you dont agree with them!	I think calling entitled misogynistic men with delusional ideas about women psychopaths is important	0
1	Ok retard	OK fatty and ugly.	0
1	School is supposed to be an addition to a childs upbringing….  What is wrong with these people?	They also had bad parents.	0
1	Get called an incel because people in other subs disagree with what you say.   What the hell kind of insult is that anyway? I have a wife and 3 kids, so you just sound like you're too retarded to come up with a response to what I said.	Stable relationship since 2008 here! And my other half will always make far more money than me doing a stereotypically male job, so it's not like I exist in some hideous carnival of misogyny in my private life.	0
1	It’s not about healthcare, it is about control.	And profit. That is where this is all going.	0
1	What about the mental health factors?  You really think a severely mentally ill person is at fault for being homeless?	Yep, either lock em up, or allow winter to take them.	0
1	You looking forward to living in a nursing home under these conditions? Don't you worry. You'll endure plenty.	But it will be short.  Someone in their twenties has a lot more to lose.	0
1	I think they should offer an alternative to students with speech or anxiety related ieps or 504s, and be able to remove any student who mocks or otherwise insults the speaker. If those two conditions cannot be met, then better to wait until college.	Good point!!	0
1	Academic grades and behaviour grades are given separately. They are in two different sections of the report card.	That's not what he said and you know it.	0
1	Oh child. I'm sorry your education is failing you.  Be better.	lol you sound like a child	1
1	Yeah those people are mentally ill	All of them?	0
1	Typical man assuming that he knows everything and then getting pissy when somebody tells him otherwise. Love that you like to make fun of mental health issues and make jokes about clinical insanity. Really honestly the ableist attitude looks great on you.	Thats pretty sexist  >Typical man assuming that he knows everything and then getting pissy	0
1	Ok I’m sorry but seriously how tf did a dementia patient get elected as one of the most powerful people on this earth	That many people hate Trump that much.	0
1	They did a small study on engineering students in Sweden. 80% fell within the clinical definition of autism. ADHD is also overrepresented among CEOs. So it begs the question on how to get an abnormally wealthy man if they only want to date normies.	> ADHD is also overrepresented among CEOs.  it is because probably people with adhd tend to take more risky desicions i guess i heard this first time tho	0
1	Only for elderly, people with disability or injury and pregnant woman.	Old and disabled people only. Should have gotten pregnant by a dude w a car lmao.	0
1	Exactly! I think it hits a nerve in them, that cognitive dissonance they feel because they *know* you have a valid point and they feel like it’s a personal attack because they are going along with it.	They will rabidly argue with actual porn stars on Twitter about how they're wrong.	0
1	I honestly don't need to, ur clearly a psycho	Stop harassing me over a joke.	0
1	Didn't say I didn't think they weren't disabled. Said they aren't disabled enough to need to park any closer 🤷‍♀️	>If you can get into a lifted truck you're not disabled.  Think you need to get tested for Alzheimers.	0

1	What does an extremely mentally retarded person look like? Same pic.	Don't give her an out. She's bad, not mad.	0
1	That’s when you use mom or dad’s insurance if available.  I had the opportunity to do that and declined because I have a surgery phobia.  I definitely regret not having done it sooner.	In my case it wasn't covered by insurance, my mom was poor and my dad an asshole.	0
1	Never thought of PTSD as a possible diagnosis.	Please seek help. Also if your first therapist gives you off feelings, you can always change therapists.	0
1	yes it's much better to have an unwanted child that suffers than remove a clump of cells with no feeling.	It definitely is. Life is better than death.	0
1	It would be helpful not to use the broad term “mental illness,” though. Some mental illnesses are NBD for public office, while some absolutely should be disqualifying.	That's a good point. There's a world of difference between generalized anxiety disorder or ADHD and something like NPD.	0
1	That's why they don't want to provide free childcare,free health care or anything else to do with kids.	Mitch didn't renew feeding them lunches. Wants them to starve.	0
1	Maybe it’s the autism speaking but that sounds like a compliment to me and personally I’d be flattered. But I’m not trying to tell you how to feel either. The response to your concern is concerning.	to some people it'll be a compliment and to some people it will be uncomfortable and harassment.	0
1	100%. This level of psychopathy is an extremely dangerous indicator of violence. I hope she’s able to disappear after this so he can’t track her down.	This is what I'm scared of. This man is certainly capable of murder or physical violence and these were just the first signs.	0
1	Health benefits, easy commute, workload  I guess. Not stuff the employer wants to hear so it's back to fluffing and sounding passionate.	You literally don’t care what the company does? You’d work for Phillip Morris? An Amazonian logging company?	0
1	The word “aftercare” in itself is messed up. Like maybe something is wrong with what you’re doing if you’re so mentally drained after	>The word “aftercare” in itself is messed up. Like maybe something is wrong with what you’re doing if you’re so mentally drained after   THIS! Sex is supposed to be FUN! I shouldn't need a goddam therapy session when its over!	0
1	I take meds, and I use delta 8 every now and then I refuse to do anything illegal	That's good - although a lot of people have hurt themselves with legal drugs.  (Oxy comes to mind.)   I don't know what is Delta 8.   Just take care of yourself, since you have that history.   You are beloved of God.	0
1	Dr Jill ought to be all over this. She's a great doctor.	--- something the ladies of the view would say.	0
1	The point is its not her job to fix you. Your crappy upbringing should be between you and your therapist.	Why not? Somebody has to fix it	0
1	Dunno, but I'm referring specifically to unwanted children raised without sufficient resources, with chronic/toxic stress, likely trauma and ACEs, and subsequently developing mood or behavioral problems.	Good thing they’ll have you to help them?	0
1	Yes, but I would also abort them if they weren’t on the autism spectrum	True equality. As an autistic person, I understand	0
1	old school  parenting  doesn't work just going around in circles young adults don't open up and start experimenting with   * sex and pyrography * drugs * alcohol	Getting your child therapy is most definitely not "old school parenting"	0
1	do we somehow think that a 40 year immunologist shouldn't have more "pull" in a pandemic? FFS it isn't politics that is more important in a pandemic	Maybe Fauci should act more like a doctor and less like a politician then.	0
1	When ED meds hit the market there was a big uptick in STD’s in the retired population.	That wasn’t just a Parks and Rec episode? Man, real life truly is based on TV.	0
1	Probably has some kind of psychological disorder, like sociopathy or psychopathy.	Yes, I was sad but glad to hear he hung himself recently.	0
1	Look at that, OP thinks an honorary PHD is exactly like a normal PHD.  Google is free.	Really thinks that people are earnestly calling Taylor "Dr. Swift."	0
1	We’ll it is quite possible for a child to be both! Perhaps he was later dx ‘d with autism as well. Autism wasn’t really a recognized disorder in the early 1970s.	We are pretty much waiting for the autism spectrum addition due to it's prevalence in the genetic situation of our daughter. Wouldn't be surprised if it was also a secondary diagnosis in DS as well.	0
1	What’s your definition of great? For entirety of history healthcare is at it’s peak. A mere 200, years ago, a large cut to the leg is considered life threatening. Today it’s a minor injury.	Okay, in that perspective it's true then. I was probably projecting something.  It's just, sure for the individual it is often a much easier life. There is still some room for improvement tho, I'm a critical sceptic, you know? :)	0
1	You ok? You having a stroke?	Sorry typing whilst my hands are cold I’m outside	0
1	Lack of universal health coverage.	This! I need to know more about that, however.	0
1	It’s not.   I’m saying when they can’t cope, then that makes it a medical problem. Right?	Doesn’t seem like a medical problem, but rather just a person needing some help	1
1	I work for a software company and we make insurance software. There are zero fields in our software to indicate hearing ability.   But the part about deaf removing their hearing aids or turning off the cochlear implant from being overwhelmed is true.	My mother has a story about coming to pick me up at school for an afternoon appointment and finding me in the cafeteria with my hearing aids off, peacefully lost in a book. In about, eh, third grade or so. So, you know. Rocket level decibels.	0
1	I think that’s a little extreme… I most likely just need another dosage of meds.	Yeah but how long has this been an issue though?	0
1	Do you think people with tourettes are not socially active or "normal" .....	omg. she doesn't have it though.	0
1	What symptoms did he he show that made you realize something was wrong?	Heavy breathing. It came on very suddenly	0
1	That cancerous lump you were going to have removed, the New York saying 'forget about it'.	Fuggit bout it! My dad had lots cancers he lives into his 30s....no big deal. Ya knows?	0
1	Now that we're established that my post concerns physically able people, can we stop having this conversation?	Perhaps you should include that in your original OP instead of moving goalposts then.	0
1	this is apparently a marker for autism in children.	Yep, my wife used to do autism research.	0
1	Therapy?  You see your kid is depressed and behaves strangely. What do you do?   You ignore it 🤡	I don’t know anything about her childhood, and not ruling out the scenario you mention, just saying it seems like an assumption.	0
1	Human rights definitely.  Unsure about discrimination just because they can say yes we were absolute retards but…..	If they've only taken these measures against the boys, then that is open and shut discrimination.	0
1	I would agree that euthanasia should be available to terminal, dying patients, but no, it shouldn't be available to healthy people or people who have a terminal illness but aren't immediately dying.	why not?	0
1	Do you, honestly, think that you have an accurate understanding of CRT? Not lying to yourself, in your heart of hearts, are you sure you did the research, read up on, and formulate an accurate opinion on the topic?	You can’t even tell me how I’m wrong because it’s such a heavy topic. That why it should stay in university and not be taught in the military.	0
1	I also don’t think it was ableist, but it is a joke about a real medical condition, and that is something that disabled people have to deal with a lot as well, so I could see why someone could feel personally offended by it	Apparently Rock also has a real medical condition. https://www.today.com/health/chris-rock-reveals-nonverbal-learning-disorder-diagnosis-t192072	0
1	Babies can be tough to handle sometimes, I wish you the best of luck	Happy Cake day OP!	0
1	Strong disabled white conservative male, exactly what they need.	Hell have the disabled Nazi vote for sure.	0
1	I'm finally going to start therapy this month. Proud of myself.	Hope this helps you mate , sending positivity!	0
1	I read this as though ‘crawl space’ was a social media platform for psychopaths.	Gives a whole new meaning to Facebook.	0
1	If your sick from stress, physically or mentally then yes you should call in sick but if you just want time with your family then you should book the time off or change your days off to suite you.	it was a little bit of both	0
1	But her daughter isn't using them. These are emergency pads to pass out in class.	So? Maybe her friends are more comfortable in the non-mattress style pads too?	0
1	It’s what I keep hearing but if my symptoms were the same as the I unvaxxed then what benefit did I gain?	Exactly, that phrase is based on nothing. A true test is someone who had covid and then got covid after. Even then it totally invalidates the purposes of a vaccine in the first place	0
1	I feel your pain… although people thanking god after a successful procedure is ny pick for the most stupid/infuriating nonsense in hospitals	That is definitely the worst by far.	0
1	Just ADHD and ASD. Not really sure about those, but I'm not really sure about anything and who am i to argue against multiple professionals.	They will change their damned manual yet again soon. DSM whatever.	0
1	It is like that in all mental hospitals here? I live in Guate, and I friend of mine had thought of going to the psych ward to go through alcohol detox. I’m kinda glad now that he’s decided to go home to Canada first..	The state operated facilities are dangerous, overloaded with corruption, mafia, and limited resources. Privately run facilities might be better, but I have not investigated those.	0
1	I don't know, I don't go to doctor anymore	which doctor?	0
1	I miss my mom, we talked at least 3 days a week right up untill about a month before she died.   Cancer sucks, she fought it off 3 times and held on for almost 30 years before it finally over took her.	I just wanted  to say, God damn... three times? Thirty years? your mom is an absolute warrior and her legend will live on forever	0
1	There should be a licence that people need to get in order to breed. All these mentally unstable dumb fucks are breeding like rabbits.	It would be biased too lol.	1
1	Yeah. Here's hoping you can overcome that lobotomy and finally talk sense.	Come on, now you're just being a sore loser. You can do better. Well, actually, probably not.	0
1	OP opened with this info.   &gt; I, F(19) have been clinically diagnosed by a doctor as disabled. I require the assistance of a service dog to mitigate my disability. I've been teamed with my dog for 2 years now, and it's been great.	Many people refer to their ESA as a “service dog.”  ESA dogs are not covered by the ADA. OPs dog is a real service dog, but her original post (where she talked about how her disability could not be seen) left open the possibility that it was an ESA.	0
1	The abstract of this paper literally says, “The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms are poorly understood at present.”  So the article that you linked says that we do not have an understanding of the underlying mechanisms.	And you're falsely interpreting that to mean that has nothing to do with COVID infections	0
1	I read this as though ‘crawl space’ was a social media platform for psychopaths.	r/CrazyIdeas	0
1	Replace the SAT with an IQ test and add in an IQ requirement and less funds will be wasted for everyone involved. The SAT already tries to do this in the most PC way possible. If you want to make higher education only for the gifted at least do it right.	IQ tests are literally no different than SATs, buddy	0
1	You a psycho?	I suppose so, if that’s being psychotic.	0
1	You need to tell us how well off you are so you feel better or what? Go fuck yourself.	This is a wishful thinking post. OP is probably some stressed out kid.	0
1	Personally I try not to go to any medical facility that has restrictions on what healthcare they are allowed to provide outside of law, science or their oath.	Obviously that is the goal, but we don’t always get what we want.   Doc said she does things the organization said she shouldn’t do anyway (prescribe birth control) and they have never tried to stop her.	0
1	To add on just make sure to be understanding if she is on her period or physically or mentally drained.	Indeed. Exceptions are her period, if she feels ill. However love blooms and compassion leads to it not being forced but a mutual agreement and compromise based off of love and understanding	0
1	Paralyzed by choice. There's simply too many to choose from.	That’s the debole!!!!!	0
1	So then in your definition what is the right answer to combat this disease that gives us a chance to return to normal?	I've already stated it.	0
1	If you are a healthy adult, it’s absolutely safe.	Some studies out there show it is actually good for you	0
1	Talk to your doctor, therapy and medications can help	Yes I have been taking adderall for years and it helps me focus when I am working but sometimes it doesn't help when I'm trying to relax	0
1	So please maybe you should go to therapy get your victim complex worked out get over yourself and then we’ll see where you’re at	Typical word soup.  Just mad and throwing out random insults.  Feminism's entire foundation right here in the flesh.	0
1	Bro, I gotta pay more for a bigger girl she is more likely to have diabetes and have more medical problems when she gets older, and especially with the inflation rn that's a giant hole in the pocket	You don't see Obese 90 year olds for a reason.	0
1	If your period is so bad you can't go to work you have a serious medical illness. Go on disability then.	If your period is so bad you can’t go to work that’s a normal fucking period.	1
1	What needs to be adjusted is the expectation of self, and not the physiology of the person. The latter necessarily entails health risks.	What expectation do you think young men wanting to look better should strive for?	0
1	&gt;Yeah they should still do whatever they can to avoid it  So my elderly parents with health issues shouldn't see me anymore, because you're saying I should just go out and do what I want?	Is any nuance lost on you?	0
1	People think depression is sadness.	“i’m so depressed because ……” i hear that way too much. it’s more than being sad, it’s a chemical imbalance in your brain.	0
1	When the media uses the term they have to consider the implications of the colloquial use of the word over the last several decades, not the industry specific definition used by medical practitioners.  I'm also not sure why that's hard to understand.	And what colloquial use exactly are you referring to?	0
1	Psych meds are fucking scary. Changing them around even moreso. Bad shit happens when we try and treat depression with only medication instead of figuring out what's actually fucking us up and fix it directly at the root. It's like panting over rust.	I was out on klonopin for five years, it’s been six since I’ve been off them and still have problems sometimes  I wouldn’t recommend anyone take Benzodiazepines	0
1	The 5 pain killers part ended me. ☠️	It was like 2 days worth.  For major abdominal surgery.  They told me to go back to work in a week and I was still so swollen I couldn’t put my work pants on!!!	0
1	All the nurses I know say it isn't nearly as bad as what the news is saying and most of their patients aren't even Covid related. I feel like there's a real disconnect between the PR people and the ones actually on the ground.	News needs to keep sensationalizing reality to try and keep people interested to help their ad revenue stay up from viewership.	0
1	Actually, no I don’t think they HAVE to support their child, but within reason they should WANT to! What parent doesn’t want to help their child, if needed or possible?	Supporting ones child is the least normal parents should do or they shouldn't have kids. I can't imagine throwing my barely adult son out of the house..what would have happened if op didn't have any money ?	0
1	You mean just like if an adult needs to tear down someone's entire character or intellect over one VERY small slice of possible skill and knowledge they probably have an intellectual deficiency?	That isn’t a “very” small piece of knowledge. Not being aware of something like that can cause actual harm to people.	0
1	Oh, like, the pins and needles feeling? Or a different one?	Different but same idea. The nerve is irritated or compressed so you get changes in sensation that can be “wet”, “tingling”,”numb”, “over sensitive to touch causing extreme pain”, “feel a hair on the skin but there isn’t one”. All kind of stuffs	0
1	He was in the right but I'm picking up mental health issue vibes from all three of them. The way he loses his cool is awkward.	He got slapped multiple times back to back, I feel anyone would have gotten pissed the fuck off	0
1	They should require everyone to show up with a clean STD test.	Yeah but then they would have like 50 people show up at Coachella	0
1	Also, my body my choice until it comes to allowing people to take PEDs and genetic engineering.	my body my choice until MGM.  my body my choice until unwanted female touching.  my body my choice until it comes to mens unconscious/intoxocated consent.  basically, my body my choice until it comes to anything involving mens choice.	0
1	Clever sabotage of not indoctrinating children into mental illness. Ans this has thousands of upvotes, this country is in free fall	And forcing children to dismiss education in preference of the church (home of systematic pedophilia) isn't indoctrination?  Why, you're *projecting* again!	0
1	Similar experience over here. Diagnosed at 26, haven’t had a relapse in almost 10 years.	Stories like this bring me happiness and solidify my hope in all this	0
1	...Because they're a bunch of retarded hypocrites.	Now the Twitter mobs shall cancel you for saying the new r-word	0
1	Depends on the human, 10, 2, 2, 2 and 1 usually but it varies.	Same with women. Majority of the women has ovaries. Some women born without ovaries, doesn't mean they are not women. They are anomaly. But they are not men.	0
1	Does anyone besides a few crazies say it’s natural for the weak to die off?	Yea the only ones I’ve heard say that where crazy feminists might just be who I watch.	0
1	Trying to read this post on mobile gave me cancer	Lol sorry I should have cropped it better I know that pain lol...	0
1	A mental health illness is not something on can grow up out if.  Sheesh.	Barring the fact that some disorders do in fact change or go away with time sometimes, it’s about her reactions not the illness.	0
1	No 81 year old should be in a position of power. They belong on a golf course.	The world record is 122, so that’s a lot of years of golf. Unless of course, you have further recommendations at subsequent milestones (like 90, 105, etc.)	1
1	Is there anyone in your school that you could talk to? Counselor? Social worker? Nurse? Custodian? Favorite teacher? Cafeteria staff? Teachers aid? Anyone at all at school that you would feel comfortable telling this to?	To my bad luck school counseling is horrible where I live and it wouldn't be that simple to just tell someone about it	0
1	I want mine to be like a fortune cookie! Give me some random words of wisdom/motivation to get me through the day because with cramps, bloating and whatnot, I sure as heck will need it	I swear this was a thing at one point!	0
1	But at least you can clearly communicate the volume if you see a doctor about it.	Sure! But given how many of us with diva cups are here saying, “I easily bleed 10 times the commonly accepted amount,” it seems to me that OP’s original point that we need a reassessment of the standards.	0
1	They did a small study on engineering students in Sweden. 80% fell within the clinical definition of autism. ADHD is also overrepresented among CEOs. So it begs the question on how to get an abnormally wealthy man if they only want to date normies.	I don't think they want to date anyone at all.   One of the biggest criticisms of MGTOW is that they claim to go their own way but their whole eventually circles back to women and their dating behaviour.   The same criticism applies to FDS.	0
1	So how do you feel about mothers that need to go back to work shortly after birth?  Or is all the moving around from childcare providers excusable because its the moms decision to do so?	Daytime daycare is not at all the same as sleepovers, especially if those sleepovers disrupt the baby’s routine.	0
1	I suppose we just hoped for the best as all her check ups were proving good and medical advancement has come a long way and such complications are growing less common. We were so focused on the good we didn't want to consider the bad I suppose	Complications are not growing less common. Morbidity and mortality rates are rising. Sorry that things didn’t turn out the way you wanted. If your wife wants her mother to help, let her have that.	0
1	If there's a 110 pound rat driving them crazy during those imaginary war scenarios then yeah, bash that rat. You really are retarded aren't you.	There’s some jackass that thinks a conversation about gender politics will come up in the middle of battle. He’s not an asset to the troop. 🤦🏾‍♀️	0
1	I don’t get the obsession with pushing people to STEM. We do not have a shortage of people going to school for this.	Apple wants to drive down engineering labor costs	0
1	Yes, diabetic feet is just the beginning! Then there is all the neuropathies- blindness and nerve damage and kidney issues!!	Ugh, kidney failure is the worst.	0
1	Well, it just shows how they are psychotic then, because there is no consistency in that theory.	Yeah they’re illogical and just want to create drama and play the victim	0
1	I'm really struggling with this test also. I study for hours and days, but my score is not in a good place?	https://www.youtube.com/results?search\_query=justin+sung	0
1	Can the whole “I cook and clean” thing just die already? Those are basic life tasks all humans should be doing. It’s not a selling point, they’re the most mundane essential components of adulthood. You look stupid.	But, but he isn't living with his mother at 22...who would take care of him 😢	0
1	medications don't help' is what I'll put on my tombstone after I've thrown myself from a building again during a manic episode 👍	Good for you the medication works for you, do you experience any side effects from medication? Is there a more effective way to control your manic episodes? Are you planning to take them your whole life?	0
1	You're wrong though, because at 21 I'd been through way more than the average 20 year old and I was looking for something serious. I couldn't relate with most people my age because of past trauma.	In a few years,  you will add this relationship to your list of past traumas.	0
1	I’m going to start viewing it as a satire subreddit that might help numb the retardation it gives me.	It’s a hate subreddit. That is specifically allowed, as it’s not “hate speech” that’s disallowed on Reddit, it’s “hate speech against non white or non male people”	0
1	&gt;IRC, like Disord but for old people  I'm a near-30-year-old IRC user, pardon me while I go find a hole to crawl into /s	I'm in my mid 30's but I haven't used IRC in at least a decade.	0
1	Wow, you must have a PHD.	Kind of funny how miracles stopped happening as often as they use to huh? I wonder why?	0
1	I'm sitting here just super relieved I don't have cancer or something and that this is a known thing	Seriously, man. No fucking joke, this has been fucking incredible.	0
1	I STILL don't know anyone that knows anyone else, that knows anyone else with a friend or family member that has died of it. 4 of my family members (all over 70) had it and didn't have symptoms.	My friend’s soon to be ex-boyfriend’s grandma (whom I’ve never met) supposedly had it and died. She was 90.	0
1	I'll do it again; it's called ADHD now, ADD isn't an official diagnosis anymore.	Okay well ADD was MY diagnosis. When I was rediagnosied in 2001 it was still ADD.  Be gone troll	0
1	The groups you demonize give people a sense of community actually. That's part of the reason people are so willing to fight for them(What you call division). You do a disservice to people with mental illness when you claim they do it for attention.	Am I demonizing them or just saying my opinion? If it helps with minimizing your symptoms, go for it. As a victim of the mental health system abuse that is MY perceptive and you are missing the point of the post.	0
1	If I was a teacher I would hate this, and would quit, even if I wasn't teaching CRT. I don't want this shit taught in schools, but this is definitely the solution to the problem. We wouldn't have teachers at all if this were the case.	It would also be a good thing for the teachers. It would eliminate all kinds of false accusations.	0
1	Somehow I trust the American Heart Association more than I trust Twitter...in general but also in this case.	Don't trust either of them lol.	0
1	True stop comaring fe*inist to mentally ill people	Yes even I'm smarter	0
1	Can't make heads or tails as to what you are referring to, and you continue to refuse to clarify it, so it seems more likely you have suffered some sort of trauma.	Or, again, you simply can't read	0
1	brainwashed and close minded much?	This is what actual Islam is, it is the true test.	0
1	Dentist here, this experience varies so wildly per patient it's crazy. Majority are cake walks	When the local anesthetic wore off after that procedure I honestly thought I was dying.	0
1	Oh yeah, don’t worry about asking. I have ADHD? Would that have an effect here though?	I’m not sure. I have ADHD too :)	0
1	You can ask for limits on the damage it does to kids too young to understand.  Some people find solace in grieving, some weaponize it.  ENT ... OP is AC asshole, but dad needs help.    ENT = everyone needs therapy	it’s a grief journal, a therapist would literally recommend he writes one because it helps them process their grief.   YTA op, wtf is wrong with you	0
1	Geriatrics are just as unfit for office as teens.  Age out at 80, go do something else.	look class war and all that but generational war on boomers. Mandatory retirements, Alzheimer tests to vote and drive.	0
1	Yes even a handicapped person can hire Usain Bolt  That doesn't mitigate any inherent problems and is only a temporary workaround	What? You do realise most owners are not CEOs... You can literally pay people to work their assess off to keep you rich.	0
1	In therapy but I need more	Give therapy/meds time, if u keep working on yourself, you'll get results, promiss u	0
1	I want mine to be like a fortune cookie! Give me some random words of wisdom/motivation to get me through the day because with cramps, bloating and whatnot, I sure as heck will need it	In Australia the Libra pads have fun facts on the wrappers	0
1	Emotionally based suicide survivors are more opinionated because they saw how good life could be when they survived.	And there are likely even more that remained miserable wishing they had the guts to do it	0
1	The “dying of a disease that you can do nothing to change” part threw me off a little bit. I know five people who had cancer, keyword being “had.” Cancer treatment is a thing. Cancer is curable and manageable.	Yes, by doctors, with medicine. Not by any choice you can make other than allowing yourself to be treated.	0
1	Hell no, where did you get that from? Honestly, are you on your period or something to be saying stuff like that?  Because it's unbelievable, the other person and I are just explaining true facts.	Your saying that the men’s population doesn’t matter and that only women do people they’re the ones who can actually make babies.	0
1	Except the data says it literally is doing them "much good." Recovery in 3 days, vs 2 weeks. 9 time's as likely to survive.	Oh, really? You work in an ICU? Please share more of your informed opinion with me. I'm talking about previously vaccinated, pretty much not doing any good at this point.	0
1	Which is worse, half a minute of the worst pain you have ever had, or around 75 years of depression and a life of suffering.	As one who suffers from depression: getting stabbed.	0
1	If I was a teacher I would hate this, and would quit, even if I wasn't teaching CRT. I don't want this shit taught in schools, but this is definitely the solution to the problem. We wouldn't have teachers at all if this were the case.	Cops should wear body cams, why can't teachers have audio feeds in class rooms?	0
1	Or just live in a sane country with universal healthcare and not worry about healthcare.	Wildly unhelpful response	0
1	As a childcare worker who has dealt with many, *many* kids:  your child’s behavior is not every child’s behavior	So lock this kid up until they go to school for the first time and then freaks out at his class size? As a child care worker you should know stranger danger is a developmental phase. You are assuming an extreme outcome.	0
1	Mental sickness	Yes you	0
1	Life Coach - another person trying to be a therapist, but without credentials	Yup, life coaches are pointless leeches that seek to help one else but themselves.	0
1	Exhausting. I’d rather grey rock and keep it moving.	Yeah me too.	0
1	Geez some people are just plain psychopaths	not even that -- some people are so hurt and so disgustingly weak that they cannot seek help or do anything to better themselves and instead have to hurt others as a way to cope w their own pain.	0
1	How else would you describe people with medical problems?	I wouldn’t refer to them as “hey, the guy with one arm” (? Quite simple	0
1	Next thing you know they will start blaming it on hysteria again	I think people are already getting that when they end up with long Covid. I’ve seen people before’s to fill out health anxiety questionnaires about their long Covid. Like ME/CFS When it happens to women it will be blamed on mental illness	0
1	Even for infantilising an adult?	Didn’t happen	0
1	So doubling-down on delusional nonsense as an explanation of that delusional nonsense...  Weird flex, but ok...	Nope.	0
1	I don't.  Seven heart attacks, a stroke, and a brain tumor.	So why still faithful to God?	0
1	Health isn’t physics.	But it is black and white. You’re either healthy or you’re not.	0
1	He actually went through the surgery, and the treatment	He's probably identified as a man for a really long time and only recently felt comfortable making it public.	0
1	You need to go complain to the management of the daycare. Really.	After reading these comments, I think I’m going to.	0
1	While health care workers shouldnt complain that they are busy while at work I also dont think its fair to say they shouldnt complain about being short staffed when it causes them to be called into work more often and prevents them from taking days off.	They can complain to the government about it. Not to patients who are ALSO getting shafted by the short staffing.	0
1	Did your physiotherapist recommend it or is this a self prescribed relief?	This is self prescribed, I did not really think about untill your question so I will take that with me to the next session!	0
1	Nobody knows what phase he is in.  I think it’s the one right before the comatose state sets in.	He and Biden are on the same level then. At least they're on the same page.	0
1	Great for the insurance company.  How about no care for the unvaccinated, when the ICUs are full.	That makes more sense to me.    This is the same as saying people have to pay for abortion out of pocket unsubsidized unless they prove they were on birth control.	0
1	Surgical masks and cloth masks have approximately the same efficacy, whether you wear them or not.	https://www.pnas.org/content/118/4/e2014564118	0
1	When my dad was diagnosed he was given a high chance of only needing a few rounds because it was caught so early. Additional rounds added a few months later and he didn’t make it because cancer grew quicker than he treatments could keep up with.	this is the first thing i thought of—if the kids’ bio mom does pass, i’m sure OP will take his kids in. i’m not sure if this is a discussion they’ve had (and if not, it needs to happen ASAP) but wife needs to get herself together regardless.	0
1	Lmao are people here mentally retarded? Did they actually think I was serious that they downvoted me lol. I will choose to believe that they just didn't like my sense of humor.	> I will choose to believe that they just didn't like my sense of humor.  Wahmen aren't funny.	0
1	You may have done some hypocritical actions but I would not *define* you as a hypocrite. More like someone struggling with issues.	What hypocrital actions did I mention?	0
1	They attempted to rape two of their dogs. They raped a minor with a developmental disability, attempted to rape a minor, raped an unconscious drugged woman. Had justifications/explanations for it all and how they didn’t believe they’d done anything wrong.	😮😮😮😮😮	0
1	Here's what is actually being said, "a child without trauma is better than a child with trauma"	Absolutely deranged way to think about it.  "I would rather my child be untraumatized"  Is very different to  "It would be better for my child to die and be replaced with an untraumatized one"	1
1	I’m pretty sure that back in the 90’s, the court ruled that it is legal for protesters to demonstrate outside the home of Planed Parenthood employees.	Never start an argument with pretty sure.	0
1	Yeah, and then there's that guy in the wheelchair too.	Underrated comment	0
1	Internalized misogyny is an actual thing but ok - go off.	No, no it's not.  You need to put down the feminism, it's damaging your brain permanently.	0
1	Couldn’t you easily say the same for obese people? Smokers? Reckless drivers? Diabetics? Would you consider all of these people, whose medical conditions are usually self-imposed, burdens on the healthcare system?	No you couldn’t, unless there were vaccines for those things.	1
1	Still I’d definitely ask the doctor/gynecologist and get labs done for that.	I think that’s a little extreme… I most likely just need another dosage of meds.	0
1	That’s a retarded train of thought and once again leaves the kid the one suffering	Right but why is a kid suffering my problem though? Not trying to be rude just asking.	0
1	this is precisely the kind of thing i was going for. No need to get rid of all problems that need to be solved, but a herniated disk...how is that necessary?	I hope you get well soon. I also had a hietal hernia. I guess hernitaiton is very bad no matter where it is. 🫣	0
1	But you can’t change what other people do.  Sure, you can be angry but I’m not sure that festering is the best approach for mental health.	Lately I've been looking for pro male bumper stickers.  I feel like that's the best approach.	0
1	To do things like cook a meal once a week or to assist my sister if she needs anything (like food brought to her, tying her shoes, bringing her medication to her) for 1 or 2 hours a week.	So you want him to give up his life and independence  to come home, and take care of you sick sister, you are most certainly the asshole, there is no upside to him coming home.	0
1	Is she going to faint? Looks like a nervous breakdown about to happen.	She’s going through some things.	0
1	INFO: has she ever been tested for inattentive ADHD.  This sounds extremely similar to what I dealt with before I was diagnosed.  Depression and anxiety are coming for undiagnosed adhd. Once I started medication everything changed	Yes she asked the therapist to do a ADHD diagnosis and BPD (borderline personality disorder). The therapist said while she exhibits some of them, it’s not strong enough to be either and it’s circumstantial anxiety and depression.	0
1	True In the begginning i though they would be more intelligent but as i can see they are one of the most retard-minded people imo	Does that mindset only apply to feminists or to all subreddits that ban people for not speaking hive?	1
1	I love that in your world doctors aren’t qualified to make a diagnosis but you are	I'd wager most people spending every second talking about their mental health aren't diagnosed	0
1	Do you need someone to talk to?  Are you feeling ok?	My brains a mess and I'm not really making much sense so would be kinda pointless	0
1	Barely up and walking after a week? You’re up and walking in hours and home in 3 days max. You’re definitely not 100% but hardly unable to do anything. After #2 I left the hospital and went straight to a baby shower	Congratulations. Was that very comfortable for you?	0
1	Thanks! Definitely broke the cycle. I am the first person in my family to get a degree. I am also happy to say I have motivated my sister, who is in high school, to get a degree and she wants to become a doctor!	Nice.	0
1	This users post claims that some appear to have mental illness, to which you responded “They should be shamed.” So as OP is stating, even if a “Karen” is acting out publicly because she is mentally ill, you believe she should be shamed?	I mean, there really is no evidence that these people are mentally ill. This is just armchair reddit psychology at its best	1
1	You might want to watch for additional symptoms.	I’ll look them up and see. My dad said that day she was acting weird. But if she has dementia then that’ll severely worry me about me developing it. She’s also only 59 now. Idk if it’s normal to get it that early or what. I’ll do research, thank you.	0
1	You said intellectually disabled toddlers, but there is a lot of logic and reasoning behind their belief. Your personality is affected by the year and date you were born. Magnetic fields, gravity etc.	Don’t. Please just don’t. I’m not in the mood.	0
1	My kid ain’t smart enough to be an engineer.  He’s got ADHD and dyslexia. He’s setting himself up to fail.	Neither of those things have anything to do with intelligence. The real draw-back he has is being related to a moron like you.	1
1	Because it’s the one that we need right now for public health.	You mean the vaccine they already admitted doesn't work for the new variant?  The one that doesn't prevent transmission or infection?  That vaccine?	0
1	That definitely would. Just keep watching your symptoms and if you ever need to chat I’m happy to chat to you	Thx ;)	0
1	Who elects someone with virtually zero experience to be a director of the board of education? This guy is making decisions that affect the education of thousands of children, yet has pretty much no experience in education.	Wait until you hear about the GOPs last choice for President!	0
1	My mom is confined to a wheelchair...  And I still laughed my ass off.  Well done!	Is your mom a piece of shit, thug, sex predator, traitor, nitwit, and Hitler youth looking Ken doll?   That's the difference.	0
1	Could very well be.   Where do think this mentally challenged ideology comes from? And is empowered through?	They're not mentally challenged. They're just regular bigots.	0
1	Most shrinks are actually morons.   So taking their opinion at value on who can possess a gun and who cannot, would be a huge issue and mistake.	Hence my extreme reservations and reluctance to provide anyone that power.	0
1	What are your qualifications to diagnose a mental illness based on an opinion you've formed by reading a few paragraphs?   She may need help but only a qualified therapist can make that determination.	Yes, hence why the last sentence of both of my comments are about seeing a professional to get a diagnosis and treatment.	0
1	There’s differences in rejections and not understanding/being mentally ill and struggling to.	If your mentally ill or struggling to understand I apologise	0
1	The pain stopping after a kidney stone had passed.	Ive never had a kidney stone how did u get it?	0
1	Is he ok? I think he’s got some serious mental issues	Think?   No… rest assured he does	0
1	&gt;IRC, like Disord but for old people  I'm a near-30-year-old IRC user, pardon me while I go find a hole to crawl into /s	28 and never heard of IRC. Makes me feel a little better.	0
1	The administration of drugs to treat disease depends on many factors. The type of inflammation occurring in RA is not the same as during Covid.	I use blood pressure meds for ADD. What's your point? It's not about HCQ treating inflammation it's that it helps keep the virus from entering the cells.	0
1	He doesn't have one, because it's based on delusional overreaction.	Delusional positions are still positions.	0
1	I was a but disoriented last night. Sorry. I don't plan to and haven't for a long time.	Ah! Alrightie!	0
1	I like Medicare, but it services a small amount of people for a good size chunk of the budget.	It's more efficient than private insurance. The costs borne by the average health insurance beneficiary aren't factored into those numbers	0
1	&gt;The other group wants to kill fully developed babies up to birth.  Which group specifically wants to kill babies up to birth?	That'd be the democrats.	0
1	A new camera lens and a new adidas shoe I also went to a job with 20% less pay  but more human conditions..kinda feels like I bought bits of my mental health with it	A bunch of mental health! Good on you for making the decision to move to a different job	0
1	I agree they should get vaccinated and boostered but I don’t think the making the human right of health care less accessible to them is either a moral or effective way to achieve that	If healthcare really was a human right in this country, cost wouldn't be a major factor for most people.	0
1	My niece just started crawling at 8 months and her pediatrician says that's advanced. Still not talking yet (outside of incoherent babbling and shrieks) so clearly she's not as advanced as OP's super baby /s.	It's basic developmental biology. Locomotion comes before communication because it has greater survival value.	0
1	Exactly. What if it was a disease afflicting 1% of the population?	It is definitely note the case that 1% of the population has a disease causing them to likely die by the age of 20. Presumably you meant 0.01% or something.	0
1	What I’m saying is when these people who had been clinically dead were revived they do not recall anything happening.	How big is this sample size? How big does it need to be for us to say for certain that there isn't an afterlife? How do we test for that in a controlled environment?	0
1	I think you should look for a good therapist online and just hope for the best.	This is sound advice for anyone.	0
1	What I am having a hard time accepting: Why I should consider societal focus on child prodigies a net good to society, rather than a detriment or a distraction from more pressing concerns (like better public education, and so on).	Honestly even if we did focus more on improving education, people will still talk about child prodigies or at least above average children.	0
1	Universal health care isn’t going to solve the COVID death rates and anyone arguing otherwise isn’t going to know how to explain how it exactly would.	It should prevent people going bankrupt from getting the virus though.	0
1	Oh I know what that whole line of argument is and just had trouble believing that a supposedly functional and working adult would stoop so low. But you are continuing to force me to update my expectations.	Yeah sorry, ligma is very serious and I can’t believe I fucked up like that	0
1	Geriatrics are just as unfit for office as teens.  Age out at 80, go do something else.	Or pass cognitive tests. Bernie is still all there. I work with people in their 50s who can’t think clearly.	1
1	I am not denying that what I am saying is we need to address the anxiety behind it or risk becoming paralyzed and doing nothing to fix it.	Maybe action would be the cure for anxiety.	0
1	Too be fair I'm a grade 1 klutz who can give myself a concussion with my keyboard.  I'm def prone to accidents, want to know what I don't do, take fucking pain meds, seriously. It is so easy to become hooked on them.	I dislocated my knee petting a cat :( I'm the least athletic person	0
1	The mom called the doctor again..  the doctor is definitely annoyed...	Once again, he reminded the monkeys “No more jumping on the bed!”  **3 monkeys remaining**	0
1	STEM degrees don't usually lead to much manual labor.	Those degrees can lead to overseeing manual labor or dealing with tradesMEN in manners that few jobs do. A EE explaining to the electrician foreman the intricacies of grounding. A ME and the HVAC technician, a Structural Engineer and the ironworkers.	0
1	that’s like saying anorexia is healthy	No, that’s too low of a BMI.  Are you just trolling or do you actually not understand how weight is important for health?	0
1	You guys have to buy cancer medication off the internet?  This boggles my mind.	I’m in England, so no I don’t.	0
1	A 20/30 year old having chest pains is NOT OK.	A 20/30 year old having chest pains is probably indigestion or heartburn.   A 60 year old is probably giving a heart attack.	0
1	Judging by the posts and comments in this sub...if you were capable of an actual conversation you all wouldn't have such a retarded thought process and think these things to begin with.	So instead of conversation, you just resort to ad hominem attacks?  I’m open to talking to you, but you claim I’m closed minded.  That speaks more about you than it does about me.	1
1	I honestly think this trial is going to damage her career. Being “crazy psycho” can work to a degree (hello Sharon Stone) but batshit over the wall insane I think is a full stop for a lot of studios	It should damage her career. His career is already in shambles why shouldn't she face the same consequences?	0
1	What about her own father? There must be something somewhere people don't get this stupid out of nothing, I refuse to believe you can brainwash like this somebody who's not deeply hurt.	People believe all types of propaganda. There's bound to be a few that believe some stupid shit.	0
1	Hey I was in the same boat! Just finished my last chemo treatment last week. Cancer free now!!!	Congratulations! There’s a great community over at r/testicularcancer if you’re ever looking to encourage others with your story.	0
1	Curing my all health problems. Easy.	this is precisely the kind of thing i was going for. No need to get rid of all problems that need to be solved, but a herniated disk...how is that necessary?	0
1	My kid ain’t smart enough to be an engineer.  He’s got ADHD and dyslexia. He’s setting himself up to fail.	It’s clear now that you’re just jealous of the life your sister got to live after fucking yours up by having a kid. That isn’t the kid’s fault, but you resent him anyway. For that, you’re an asshole	0
1	That's like, one of the major staples of autism or ADHD	Wait what	0
1	Youre a therapist? Really? Wow. I've been looking for one. Do you work online?   Asking for a friend.   Ass	::hug::  Sorry even your own kids don’t want to spend the holidays with you!   But seriously, therapy would help.	0
1	It’s obvious you have the insight of yourself needed to make these determinations then. I never claimed to understand OCD. This is an atheism sub, not an OCD sub. If you wanted OCD-specific advice, perhaps an OCD sub would suit you better, thanks.	Ok, thats fair enough.	0
1	I looked up the title and saw an earlier repost of this, from a year ago. A few comments said he had Down's and that he's a school boy.	Teens and men with disability should not get a pass (even though they do!) in society for being aggressive and perverted.  That's not an excuse. Even if he was teen boy, he is old enough to know beating up someone is not okay.	0
1	Sorry I didn’t know I was speaking to someone with an MD. I have a faint pink spot under my right boob and I’m not sure if it’s cancer or not?	Man I still can’t get over how multiple whole-ass people on FB were following this conversation & decided that I’m the same person as that free food dude. Like are you sure you didn’t accidentally join an FAS support group? SMH	0
1	Would you consider someone mentally ill if they told you they had an invisible friend who granted them wishes?	Depends on how old they were. People definitely cause more issues with their own mind the more they try to convince themselves.  But a 40 year old religious person may not have spent any effort thinking about it as well, not causing more trauma.	0
1	Mockery of disabled children and MRAs	When did I do that?	0
1	You cannot even report a post to Reddit ? The functionality has been somehow disabled  Anyone else experienced this ?	That function is worthless unless you are a yapping feminist.	0
1	Oof.  Kids need to take the time to discover themselves and what they like/don't like first, dipping their toes into the water instead of taking the full plunge. They are, after all, a long way from being fully developed.	We weren't doing it like porn stars; just fumbling along and figuring things out. Sex-ed in our country isn't too bad; we all knew how to not make babies - it was mostly just fun.	0
1	Were you dropped on your head as a child or something? Are you a sadomasochist who gets off on making people think youre retarded? Are you a sad young person who never got enough parental love?  Like seriously bro, whats wrong with you?	Probably yes, they spend all of their free time concern trolling on this sub	0
1	I want mine to be like a fortune cookie! Give me some random words of wisdom/motivation to get me through the day because with cramps, bloating and whatnot, I sure as heck will need it	That'd be really fun too!!	0
1	Just don't get stressed out	this just makes me stress [more.lol](https://more.lol)	0
1	Omg I thought it was just me!!! I get those all the time… it’s so sick that people will use something so serious like mental illness and s-cide to try and troll you.	Lmao, that edit. They’re really getting their point across, aye? 😂	0
1	Dentist here, this experience varies so wildly per patient it's crazy. Majority are cake walks	Too true. Wait list of 8 months, whacked out no worries in ten minutes.	0
1	Yeah, shame on you for letting a mentally unstable person make fun of you	Well, you haven't. You've not said anything close to the truth so far.	1
1	I don’t get the obsession with pushing people to STEM. We do not have a shortage of people going to school for this.	stem market is already flooded and most degrees just as useless as gender studies	0
1	Thought situation. Just say get well soon and leave it at that. Cancer is awful and it sucks that any has to go through it regardless of how awful they are.	This. NTA, send a nice message, but don't be made to buy gifts if your uncomfortable.	0
1	I mean did the disabled daughter pressed charges tho??and as a scenario,was she reluctant to press charges bcz she was depending on the said man..everything has consequences if you are willing to let it affect you too	She was 6… and were you seriously going to suggest that being a disabled person dependent on your parent means it’s your fault if you get beat? Because you’d be a sick fuck to think that	0
1	I think they should offer an alternative to students with speech or anxiety related ieps or 504s, and be able to remove any student who mocks or otherwise insults the speaker. If those two conditions cannot be met, then better to wait until college.	Real life has people mocking you all the time, it if it represents real life at all, it's better than half of the other lessons you learn in hs	0
1	Because it does reduce the transmission probability and it does reduce the probability of serious health issues and death. It also reduces the strain on the medical system.	Can you share the original data you’re referencing? I’d like to take a look if you can. Hope you’re having a great day!	0
1	Anyone who would do that is definitely a psychopath.  There is such a thing as undiagnosed mental illness.	Yes. None of this fits DSM psychopathy criteria. Read the articles I posted.  Also read the article, there was no mental illness, just sweet, sweet punishment	0
1	It's probably normal during your period, but if you have it even not on your period it could be cysts on your ovaries. I've had them before and sometimes it's very painful even it is benign.	Ok, thanks. The left-side specific pain doesn’t usually happen at all, but I have had some pretty bad periods so I guess I’ll see if it happens against next period	0
1	Check state programs. I am on Medicare in Texas and my deductibles and monthly fees are covered by a Medicare savings program.	I'm betting on it with abbvie being great. But 10 years of almost not getting medicine I need to live has really damaged my mental health. Try not to panic or trip but after all I've dealt with it's hard	0
1	Rick Scott has extra lint in his pocket from being CEO of a company that was fined  **1.7 billion dollars** for Medicare fraud	And setting up a bullshit system to drug test poor people applying for aid. And the drug tests were run by his wife’s company.	0
1	Possibilities.      Healthy, educated children mean nothing if they do not get their chance to use their potential.     Without possibilities, no healthy, educated child makes any difference.	I think /u/GnosticGnome made the same potent argument. I need to think about this a bit.	0
1	How is it moral to blame tens of millions of people for the actions of a few evil psychos?	“Blame” 😩 yall Americans love to play the victim card  Its more of a take responsibility and make guns illegal..stop being a manchild	0
1	They should require everyone to show up with a clean STD test.	Excellent call, and just for funsies,  they need a clean bill of health for their nether regions before they are allowed to leave and rejoin the general population.  Nobody wants crotch critters.	0
1	Are you talking about a private millitary prep school like Oak Ridge or Camden? That's not what this thread is about. They're talking about juvenile mental health institutions like Elan or Judge Rothburg.	Not nearly the same, but some people think they are ….	0
1	Yeah, but you are not implying that autistic children are necessarily special needs, are you?	Well according to the post, the mother was looking for someone with “experience” which leads me to believe the child cannot be cared for by just any babysitter.    But why are you acting like special needs is some sort of insult?	0
1	I hate this.  Just because something could be worse that does not make it okay.   I am sorry you went through that. How are you doing now?	Thank you for the support! I bounce back faster than I used to, because good friends have taught me that I don't have to put up with things like this, and that I don't need to apologize for being creeped out by creepy behavior.	0
1	No but you kind of need your medical license	Right, but doctors don't even necessarily go through the process of giving a Hippocratic oath.	0
1	So poor people, elderly and disabled people don't socialize? How do any of these people have the human interaction required to keep sane? Do they sit at home all day and never leave their houses?	Yes some do. My mother is in Assisted Living and physically it’s very difficult for her to leave the building, which she isn’t even allowed to do because of the pandemic.  But our Constitution affords her the right to vote.	0
1	Surgical masks and cloth masks have approximately the same efficacy, whether you wear them or not.	https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/science/science-briefs/masking-science-sars-cov2.html#anchor\_1619456988446	0
1	Uhm…if you haven’t noticed, you have been overemotional here, not me. I didn’t send you CareResources.	Please point out where I've been "overemotional"	0
1	A lot of places are having to scrap this now as it breaks guidelines for those of us who are disabled. If you are able to use public transport then a company has to consider you for a role, unless of course that role is something like HGV driver etc.	Absolutely.    Photo Identication, however, is Mandatory for an I9.	0
1	What about congenital defects? What about if the mother’s life is threatened?	Too bad so sad	0
1	People with dementia say the damndest things.	Just wait until the pills don't work anymore. I'm willing to bet that they will try a media blackout.	0
1	What was the judges reasoning for ignoring the social worker's concerns?	Men bad probably	0
1	My first take is that the bio mother has issues like drugs or alcohol. Just seems like a shitshow waiting to explode.	And he probably feels needed. Her weakness makes him feel manly, a protector, a provider.	0
1	It means she’s so overweight and unhealthy, it’s affecting her body. Could eventually cause organ shutdown, diabetes, breathing issues and lots of other problems	That was exactly my point thank you! I asked that to make the other person think about the consequences :/	0
1	Yes. As someone with Autism I can say I would be given much more slack if I were a woman.	woman on the spectrum here. you would not. you would be scrutinized and people would get upset with you twice as often	0
1	I don’t mean this to be ignorant, but why are many healthcare workers refusing the shot? It’s their right to medical autonomy, but I’m unsure of their reasoning. Do they not trust it to work, or are people concerned with side effects?	Some can't get it, some don't want it and/or don't trust it. Most are saying their natural immunity is enough as they've already been exposed. An Israeli study backs this up.	0
1	You’re welcome. Get a therapist for that next time though.	What are u talking about? U are my therapist.	0
1	My kid ain’t smart enough to be an engineer.  He’s got ADHD and dyslexia. He’s setting himself up to fail.	What’d your kid do to make you hate him so much?  WAIT, does he bear resemblance to your sister??	1
1	I had an ultrasound done originally, but I had a tumor (I’m all good) and I think they needed to see where the biopsy clips were or something like that	I see!	0
1	Not going to believe my aunt if she had no medical degree (although my aunt is a doctor, so I probably would).	You may not, but tons of other people do.  And it's not just "I believe her" it's "if I see this enough times it raises doubt even though I suspect she is wrong" which can be just as dangerous.	0
1	It IS actually legally punishable to suggest a person with mental health issues end their life. So the fact this man had documented issues puts legal ramifications on the girl here.	Oh yeah, that's right, Australia...a country that lately has demonstrated respect for human rights. /s	0
1	Yeah good point I suppose it's not fair on retards to compare Hilary with retards sorry retards	I am a high functioning autist, aka a retard. I call myself retarded all the time, and I call people who are acting like a retard; retarded.  You may call Hillary Clinton retarded, as she in my books, acts like a retard.	0
1	Where is your evidence that they operate with no morals? They are under the same laws as anyone else. If a victim has been abused they should report it to the police. Should schools be shut down for the same reason?	They are fucking children at a higher rate than children are normally fucked. Why do you keep defending this,?	0
1	If diabetics don't want to pay out the nose for insulin, maybe they shouldn't be diabetic.   /s	I mean that's all fine and good for people that I have type 2 diabetes but the type one people are just kind of stuck with it at Birth	1
1	It's even worse than you said because even in homes where there is a dad he's often so checked out he may as well not be there.	Off-topic but I hate the fact that nowadays you have to specify, “homes where there is a dad” it’s just awful…	0
1	Doesn’t help, but I can’t imagine how that would hurt people who weren’t directly affected	So in your logic unless you lost a loved one to Covid you shouldn’t be psychologically damaged by it?  That sound right?	0
1	Do you lack critical reading skills? "They will gaslight you. They can't help themselves." Sounds bad to me.	Wow, poor quality analysis on display here	0
1	Info: you say he was diagnosed his junior year of high school. What has therapy looked like for your brother in the past three years?	My parents don't believe therapy to ever work so they just leave him as he is. Hence why him and me both have some sort of mental problems.	0
1	I had one, didn't want one but they said it would help my blood pressure. It did.  Did fuck all for the pain though, I still felt everything, and my back is shot to shit 6 years later.	What do you do for back pain?	0
1	How is it moral to blame tens of millions of people for the actions of a few evil psychos?	Evil is sitting there toying with death because you want to feel powerful when the same power is being used to slaughter innocents.  If you could give up your own guns to avoid even one more person being wrongly murdered, you wouldn't. That's evil.	0
1	Why is it people who enjoy a patch on one eye are mentally unstable?	Who wears glasses AND and eye patch? Like pick one.	0
1	Your doctor likely had good intentions.	Read the post before commenting!	0
1	Because they have mental health issues which were unaddressed? I’m not justifying obvs, but usually that’s the reason.	That goes without saying. Nobody with a healthy mind is going to kill their own child.	0
1	Let me ask another way:  Would you still hold this view if someone who's in a moment of crisis and is suicidal can on a whim kill themselves this way legally with no waiting/evaluation requirements?	No they can't instantly euthanize themselves it requires the help of physician in order to achieve a painless death	0
1	My vasectomy was performed while I was awake and it took forever and I couldn’t feel pain but I could feel all the clamping and tugging. They had to do it a few times too because it wouldn’t work on one side. Pretty weird experience	I just puked a little. I don't think -kd ever do it awake or asleep. Just the thought of someone snipping at my balls cords shutters me	0
1	Medical insurance was mandated 11 years ago.	Is that so….  And yet, I know countless people who have none for either themselves or their kids. 🤔	0
1	Textbook modern-day progressivism: virtue-signal so I look good in front of my peers without suffering \*any\*, and I mean \*any\* of the consequences.  Rules for thee but not for me.  Elitism to the core.	This might be a dumb question... but what are the consequences Texans are seeing from illegal immigration?  Crime? Competition for jobs?  How does it affect the lives of average Texans?	0
1	Approximately every 3 minutes a child around the world is diagnosed with cancer!  Also around 90,000 children die every year from cancer!	This one is grim. My heart genuinely goes out to any sick children or parents of sick children.	0
1	Not all doctors are good doctors and doctors make a lot of mistakes	It’s better than having to go bankrupt to get basic treatment. Just choose your doctors wisely.	0
1	Simple: they don’t care. They aren’t affected by a potential pregnancy, they would do a hit and run.   When it comes to STDs they’re at lower risk. They are also dismissive of health problems in general.	Even the risk of 18 years child support isn’t enough to to scare them? Smh.	0
1	That’s so interesting because I don’t think the sack of cells I lost at 8 weeks was anything near a baby. So how about you focus on the actual issues? Actual child abuse, deaths of LIVING babies, post Partum depression, and adopt a kid while you’re at it!	What makes you think I don’t focus on those issues too?	0
1	You're ignoring the mountains of personal experiences pointing to a continuing of consciousness after physical death. You're operating backwards from the assumption that there is nothing after death.	Mountains of personal experiences that can't be verified in any way. There's mountains of personal experiences of people meeting Bigfoot, but we don't use that as evidence he exists.	0
1	How do you get tested for endometriosis? I thought laparoscopy was the only way to know for sure.	Vaginal ultrasound, and biopsy are a few. Ask your doctor. 🤗	0

1	Learn how to perform lymphatic drainage on yourself, specifically head and neck, it helps clear up sinuses, and facilitates your bodies natural ability to fight off the disease, longest I've been sick in 6 years is about 24 hours.	Omg. I just saw a tiktok on draining it. Tiktok was tryna tell me something. I'm gonna go find that video.	0
1	Academic grades and behaviour grades are given separately. They are in two different sections of the report card.	Grading has a lot of subjectivity, especially in grade school. There's half marks and such and topics like English have more wiggle room for grading.	0
1	You say “often”. Do you have any data to support this beyond your anecdotal experience?  Because for everything I’ve read the majority of people with ptsd that seek out treatment respond to it.	often, because even if you consider us to be a minority - the minority’s opinions shouldn’t be ignored	0
1	No, she has a sad history of mental health issues. This is why I'm choosing not to be mad at her. She's been through the worst in life.	she's got a history of mental health issues and is clearly trying to manipulate and deceive you now.  i can respect you not blaming her or being mad, but that kid ain't gonna be safe living with her.	0
1	if it makes you feel any better, this sounds more like a symptom of mental health than immaturity. i would consult a doctor about this	Did you get diagnosed with ADHD? I feel like I have that. Also I saw your post where you answered questions about Islam. May Allah reward you for defending the religion.	0
1	Does he have a disability? I'm honestly asking. He may need to see a therapist. Cause like sure I like to eat and sometimes eat snacks meant for everyone but I don't go out of my way or ever immediately go for something in someone else's room..	He doesn't have a disability. My dad's taken him to several therapists and psychiatrists over the years, but nothing has improved	0
1	Teachers ? You mean professional indoctrinators?	Excuse me?	0
1	I..... Don't see it. Am I blind or what?	No I'm with you, asking questions is a good thing imo.	0
1	Or.. hear me out... They want it because it's health care. That's it.	Birth control is optional so you can’t say it’s healthcare. That would be like saying breast implants and lip fillers are healthcare.  Also abortion is the opposite of healthcare, healthcare is for saving lives, not ending them.	0
1	I know, it never felt right but I was a people-pleaser/overly-empathic person back then, perfect target for narcs/sociopaths etc. Not anymore so, glad that's in the past!	That's the main thing, you can spot them now. I was exactly the same. My narcissistic mother primed me to attract those sort of people and they react badly to boundaries. Glad you are now free of them!	0

1	No doctor can cure child support either, and finacials can ruin a person just as fast if not faster than aids	I think if I had to choose between paying child support vs AIDs-lifelong health problems and the stigma of that disease, I'd choose child support, but that's just me...	0
1	Speaking as a man with mental health issues, I whole heartedly support their decision to avoid me. I've been through enough ;)	I certanly don't feel as if I am losing anything. Hell, I like the idea of these women considering me low status, it is less headaches down the road.	0
1	They let you keep a bra and all that for an x-ray?	Yea, idk why. This was taken a long time ago, so I don’t remember why they didn’t have me fully undress.	0

1	Diabetes has some of these symptoms, make sure to exclude that before anything else.	That did come to mind a while ago but I do not have it, thank you for your reply!	0
1	I absolutely love this movie.  However, I only have watched it once, because it is dark and rough watching his descent into madness from real world instances (bullying, disability, poverty, no father, etc.).	Or simply watch Taxi Driver, it’s way better than Joker imo, (still a great movie! But nothing new).	0
1	Was everyone ok?	Yeah, there was no one it that house when that occurred. A kid had a car accident and crashes into a house, broke a gas line and a few mins later the whole thing exploded. Lucky my father in law was able to get kid out of the car, well, teen.	0
1	I work in a large hospital system in NYC. Saw it first hand.  And to educate you, ICU's make up a small portion of a hospitals beds. So your ICU's can be overrun, and the parking lot empty as your put it.	Just like y’all needed that navy hospital boat as well eh? Fuck off. Medical staff are just shills for the drug companies.	0
1	You don't get to make that decision for adults. If they want to smoke and die then that's their choice. If they want to eat and balloon up to 600lbs abd sure from a heart attack at 40 then that's their choice too.   Stop with your bullshit.	Yeahh there was an anorexic girl in my class. My classmates let her continue eat less and less.Their reason was just like yours. When she got hospitalised, she got force fed and they just said it was sad.	0
1	And if you're going to throw the net that wide, that includes such a massive number of things that are associated with serious illness that it would be laughable.	Laughable to bring health to a patient?	1

1	I did one of those online assessments on my daughter between her teacher bringing up ADHD and her doctors appointment. Reading those questions made me realize at 40years old that I had ADHD. Made me sad for all the years I didn’t “live up to my potential”	I’m so sorry. Your daughter is very lucky to have you.	0
1	You can ask for limits on the damage it does to kids too young to understand.  Some people find solace in grieving, some weaponize it.  ENT ... OP is AC asshole, but dad needs help.    ENT = everyone needs therapy	The “damage” of him having a private grief journal that presumably nobody was supposed to read until OP invaded his privacy?  A *private* journal shouldn’t damage anyone, because presumably no one should be reading it.   YTA OP.	0
1	You are autistic. I don’t think the disconnect lies within other people, but it could be the symptoms of your condition in play keeping people from stimulating you and interesting you.	Yeah, this is like a blind person making a post, “CMV: Scenic views are boring”	0
1	Plenty of mentally stable people commit crimes.	What i'm basically saying is that some "mentally unstable" people accuse others of anything and everything.	0
1	Is this sarcasm? I’m being serious and I sometimes struggle with sarcasm because I’m autistic.	Sarcasm is also kinda difficult to see when it's just text on your screen as opposed to a sarcastic voice, so it probably doesn't make it much easier for you.	0
1	Because   It’s money.   Babies don’t have money, so they can’t pay for healthcare.   I do, so I matter.	How are you going to pay for services when you're unconscious/incapacitated? You stop mattering the moment you're no longer convenient to others, there's no reason to resuscitate you.	0
1	I literally have the whole list of symptoms for PCOS, but no one is willing to actually diagnose me. I hate it. I've all but given up.	Same!

1	This kid is going to need therapy for the rest of his fucking life.	Most likely he'll kill himself in his teens. Parents who not just force something like this on a kid but do that in the most dangerous way will most likely not care about his mental health. And him being male, nobody else will.	0
1	It is not productive for a lot of people to think that having a clinical depression is extremely common, which seems to be the case in this thread. It dilutes the diagnosis, and creates problems for the people who actually do have a clinical depression.	What does that have to do with what clinical depression is and that it’s difficult to escape a depressive episode?	1
1	Does someone on life support require someone else’s body to stay alive?	Did someone cause them to be on life support tied to them?	0
1	Honestly, the need to brag about not appearing to be brain damaged is probably a sign you're brain damaged.	He knows more about nuclear/ISIS/Bible/windmills/washing machines/energy/Ukraine/Kristen Stewart than anyone. I doubt he's brain damaged.	0

1	Well if I have to go for that then maybe you should go for that victim complex you’ve got going on.	>victim complex  What do you call a woman who spends all day on the men's rights subreddit whining about how she can't work like a normal adult at a job because her periods give her the ouchies?	0
1	Both were clots, one of them is still partially paralysed and required a 6 llitre blood transfusion. The other still struggles to walk due to leg pains and breathing difficuties.	Which vaccine was this? Did your friends have predisposition for blood clots? Do they take estrogen?	0
1	Info: Are you seeing a mental health professional at all?	No, but after reading some of your comments I most definitely will.. I thought it was a superstition from something I had heard when I was a kid, not pointing to signs of a mental health problem.	0
1	Excellent questions for your therapist. Please, please do NOT tell your mother you’re going to therapy for awhile. You’ll thank me later.    Fwiw - I was in therapy for about 14 months. It helped me a great deal. Highly recommend.	thank you so much and that’s good advice i won’t!	0
1	Blaming society for a mental illness isnt going to help	Except the issue isn't just mental illness.  Society is ageist and sexist.	0
1	A connotation that has come from an underlying issue. People don't just wake up and decide therapy makes them weak.	Why does it matter? I ultimately still use the service, so the term really is irrelevant. If I wasn't even willing to use the service, then I'd see your point.	0
1	The AI can be programmed to give all the required necessary stimulus and psychological needs   I don't think not telling a child the history of Franco Spain will lead to disability	I don't know what kind of sick society you were raised in. Children are usually taught to speak along with other societal norms.	0
1	Nta keep him blocked, maybe go back to therapist for a bit. Also try to engage with people around you - not always on the Internet.	I'm still in the care of my therapist, thank you. She actually supported me through my first blocking of him. Also I would but unfortunately, Covid makes this difficult. My country isn't the best at managing it.	0
1	4. Mom was unreachable for the entire day. What if there had been a medical emergency?	Dad was also unreliable when most needed. Which is perfectly normal and ok since he works from Home. The issue was that he took on the agreement to babysit with his wife. They were not very well prepared. But yes, Sally is mostly to blame. And wife	0
1	Fair enough, I assume that means you understand the consequences of the disease if you get it, and I hope you don’t contract if but if you do, please don’t take a hospital bed away from someone who actually needs it.	Can we apply that logic to fatties, smokers, alcholics, drug users, anyone who got an STD the fun way, and any woman (or man!) who has complications from a back-alley abortion?	0
1	I've talked to my doctor and he said that it would be no problem to just prescribe me new meds since he trusts me and has known me for ages. I am still debating if I should file a report but tbh I wouldn't feel comfortable with doing that.	Also if they're in the original packaging, they have the rx number and he can call in refills. Do not let him keep dispensing your medication. File the report.	0
1	You don’t get to decide how long a parent grieves for the child they once had. It may take years for them to come to terms with it. They are in therapy and trying, you don’t get to decide that they’ve run out of time.	Child didn’t die- it’s figuring out who they really are on the inside. I get having a harder time switching to pronouns and the right name for the child but it’s like been a year	0
1	Doctors can both "fire" current patients and refuse service to new patients.   Google "can doctors fire patients?"	You’re allowed to do things that make you a piece of shit.	0
1	I'm resistant to therapy for some reason, I don't know the block...but great idea, that would help me process this, because I'm really more confused than anything..	Whatever you ultimately decide to do, be choosy. It sounds like you already know this (others reading, however, may not), but a bad therapist is worse than no therapist at all.  And I hope this goes without saying, but we're here too.	0
1	Eh, a mental illness or drug addiction can drastically change a person's personality within months even if they were a good partner/parent for 14 years.	My point is that the longer you're married the more your punished in family court.  She's a loon and had he realized in the first few years he might have avoided going through this.  I don't believe he's a druggy based on divorce allegations.	0

1	That you can get cured. The best they can hope for, is for the patient to be able to deal with it better. But they won't tell patients that, because lots of them wouldn't take their medications, or come for therapy. So they lie to us.	there are possibilities of some disorders to be cured, but it really is so much more complicated than what it’s set out to be. but the majority of mental dissorders, are incurable and sometimes only barely management.	0

1	and those people doing whatever they want is how cancer patients die of measles	I’m sorry but just for how long are we going to continue to wear the facial vagina pads? Forever? Because that’s the road your argument takes. Freaking nutbag, check your subreddit sometime, no one here agrees with you troll piss off	0
1	I see. Strange that the "Center for Disease Control" would be in charge of that.	I agree! It honestly never crossed my mind until you just brought it up. I guess I'm kind of a dummy too for not seeing it sooner. It seemed like a lot of the milestones they tracked related to motor skills and early autism identification.	0

1	We have a serious mental health crisis in this county.	Yes, but this is a fucking understatement.	0
1	I heard it got really bad over the last 18 months though with extra long waits for even serious things like cancer treatment. Is that true or just American misinformation?	Not in my experience.

1	Well you’ll be spending much more than what you’re monthly child support would have been! Isn’t that you’re gripe?	Why would you compare monthly costs to a one-time payment? Do you think that child support over however many years will total *less* than 50k?	0
1	No, the therapist isn't the one who did that. It was someone else.	Oh. Okay.  But I really think you need therapy.	0
1	It's unethical, and he would have to convince every single person in the room to corroborate his story, which is risky. Not many nurses, assistants, workers are willing to risk their careers if someone slips up and points fingers.	Simple solution would be to ask all the people to leave room.	0

1	Honestly, the need to brag about not appearing to be brain damaged is probably a sign you're brain damaged.	Precisely!	0
1	As a scientist myself this type of shit is embarrassing. There’s a reason why social studies and psychology are *social* sciences and not regarded in the same breath as actual STEM majors.	Well, Dr. Osborne, the thing with Critical Theory is it has to infiltrate absolutely everything, and raze everything to the ground in order for the Marxist revolution to occur.	0
1	I got an autoimmune disease after having COVID 🥲	and how does it affect you?	0
1	Teachers? Public health workers? Are they just pretending to be busy?  The ones I know probably work more than most private sector workers do, often for less money.	Maybe they work more but they are apparently adding less value. I can work 16 hours digging holes and filling them up again. Doesn't mean I do more than 8 hours of coding	0
1	You are autistic. I don’t think the disconnect lies within other people, but it could be the symptoms of your condition in play keeping people from stimulating you and interesting you.

Ya know, that thing that can affect how people socialize and view relationships.	0

1	Yes, my guess is that ayahuasca allows more time and mental space for varied visions to come up.  My experiences with pure DMT have been very typical.	I do wish to try ayahuasca one day. The only psyches I have done are these in order. Lsd, shrooms, salvia, and then NN-DMT	0
1	Being autistic is not a free pass to bother people about subjects that make them uncomfortable.  You asked her twice to stop and she refused.  NTA.	Right? People who blame 100% of their bad behaviour on their mental disorder/illness/neurodivergence/whatever the PC term for it makes it harder for other people with similar conditions to be taken seriously. And it puts people like OP on the spot.	0
1	I mean… they’re missing one of the 5 senses. If that’s not a disability, idk what is	I'm insinuating that their insulting other people with disabilities by treating that term as abhorrent   But yes,  I agree with you	0

1	I also don’t think it was ableist, but it is a joke about a real medical condition, and that is something that disabled people have to deal with a lot as well, so I could see why someone could feel personally offended by it	I have suffered from male pattern baldness since I was 19 years old. I wish I had hair. Why does society deem my cosmetic illness to be less significant than Jada's? She can afford a nice wig to cover her bald head. I cannot.	0
1	What’s odd is expecting a sub unrelated to your diagnosis to give you tailor-suited, diagnosis-specific advice. I also added the super general caveat of “do what you find beneficial,” almost indicating you can do whatever you want.	No no, I was just saying! It just seems strange is all.	0
1	Yeah but I don't think it's any kinder to say that they aren't in a better place. People need their coping mechanisms.	You say neither. If someone said that "better place" shit to me after my kid died, he's getting assaulted.	0
1	I was on a prescription carousel for my anxiety/depression/mood disorder throughout high school, and I don't really remember much of those years except always being angry and tired.	Yo, me too!   And then had a psychiatrist threaten me with residential because I wasn't 'getting better'.	0
1	I want mine to be like a fortune cookie! Give me some random words of wisdom/motivation to get me through the day because with cramps, bloating and whatnot, I sure as heck will need it	Speaking of [fortune cookie](https://youtu.be/KgCOdj228lQ)	0
1	Does it matter if they die and lose consciousness?	He didn't lose consciousness, he was alive while they were eating him.	0
1	&gt;*” Certainly better than 'Herman Cain Syndrome.”*  No.  That story had a happy ending....	If only they all ended that way.	0
1	Like autism, girls are almost never evaluated for ADHD.	Which is plain criminal.	0
1	The post is severe depression and not just depression. I'd imagine if you have severe depression you cannot think rationale.	It’s just not an argument.	1
1	Autism doesn’t make you disabled just by itself. Watch yourself.	I said autistic OR disabled because discriminating against an autistic OR disabled person does make you ableist (in both cases). Please consider the context of that comment.	0
2	Stupid logic, if a woman gets fat she isn’t weight lifting	What's a woman getting fat got to do with any of this?	1
2	its relevant to the fact women are not subject to the same scrutiny and punishment for the same crimes. if this was a man, the judge wouldve never said something like this	> its relevant to the fact women are not subject to the same scrutiny and punishment for the same crimes.  The fact that she may be a first time mother is irrelevant to the crime she committed. It has nothing to do with the trial for said crime.	1
2	that’s the problem, your us vs them mentality. MOST women do not treat men like that. i know there is a small minority of women who do, but they do not define women or feminists as a whole.  they are not “them”, they are the same as us, human.	That is why I said feminists, not women. Most people I care for and love are women and they don't think like that because they are not feminists.	0
2	These are perfect examples as to why feminism and feminists need frontal lobotomies. They aren't using their brains anyways, clearly.  They won't miss what they clearly don't use.	Most feminists aren't like that. These are TRRFs (Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminists). Even mainstream feminists consider them extremists.	1
2	Promote femininity for you and your sisters: Wear feminine clothes, act femininely and submissive. Use the phrase "I have to ask my Husband first".	that isn't supporting men's rights. men's rights is about their right to mental health and wellbeing. women dressing masculine violates nothing about that. women are humans of their own that don't need permission from a man to do their shit.	1
2	Patriarchy?  Isn’t that the term feminists just apply to anything and everything that they don’t like?	It’s a lens of analysis, not that difficult to grasp 🤔	0
2	And how is ridiculing a woman for her weight not blatant misogyny	Because it has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that this person happens to have been born with 2 X-chromosomes.	1
2	Lol , I was banned from some Anti Mgtow Reddit for calling a female a female .  Told me I was being misogynistic. Me of all people 😂🤦😂	sweetie you're not gonna get cock by degrading other women and you dont need to be a man to be a misogynist	1
2	Leave you feminist bigot. We do not want your hate here. Just leave.	Lol I’m not even a feminist and I don’t hate men. Maybe you hate women?	1
2	How does this translate the modern era. Females do serve in some armies. Armies drop bombs now and how can one tell who will be in the blast.	dont kill a women who isnt fighting , its that simple. if a women comes at you attacking you  obviously are allowed to kill lol.	0
2	Women have fallen tremendously.	Feminism has	0
2	If you aren’t a feminist, your sexist. Grow up	How lol. With that logic, if you aren’t men’s rights activist, you are sexist	1
2	Yes. Men need to stop telling other men to man up. A co worker  of mine did this today. I tried to tell him this is toxicity and isn't helping and he waved his hand dismissively.  If he hasn't  experienced  the issue, it's  not a problem,  right?	absolutely. Keeping silent is not manning up, its just acting like a doormat.  Speak your mind.	0
2	About female superiority? Go read a book or something since you are clearly out of touch with reality.	MODERN feminism is about female superiority. Feminsm USED to be about equality. Modern feminism is just misandry.  And all of that aside. It is generally wrong to just say that all 'insert gender' should be killed....	0
2	Women arent bad in general, we have to be clear about that. Its feminism, which is the ideology at play. Saying "fuck women" is mysoginistic and is against the rules of this reddit.	mYSogIniStic, shut up	0
2	I’ve met people that say they are feminists (because they don’t know what is means and think it’s equality and you can see that when you have a conversation with them), that are cool	most people think feminism today still has the same ideology and goals from the 50-60's	0
2	A country that does not care about men, are not worth for men to fight for.  I was cheering for Ukraine when Russian attacked. Now I'm not so sure.  Its just another meaningless war that lower class male have to die for the rich politician.	I’m right with you, why fight for a country that hates you.	0
2	Resorting to the *"only women can be victims"* feminist card so soon I see.	Anyways you’re obviously a fucking troll because nobody can be that fucking stupid so you’re getting blocked because I’m done with your bullshit	1
2	Women make jokes about men’s bodies all the time so why can’t men do the same?	As a feminist i dont think women should	1
2	So you support women overstepping/violating men’s rights?	No cause I support equality with an emphasize on women which doesn’t mean I don’t support men. I’m a feminist because I’m not not a feminist. By definition if you aren’t a feminist then you don’t support men because you don’t support equality	1
2	&gt;You can't compare it to as if women were doing the same thing to you because you're imagining a scenario where you'd like that attention  There, it's just feminist man-hating bullshit	There are other ways a women can do similar things or things that affect men predominantly more.	0
2	Just like feminists do	wow, except, the vast majority of feminists do not do that, only the vocal minority we’re talking about... do you not see the cycle here that you’re participating in	1
2	Women don’t usually ‘invest’ in a man, not financially at least.	What do you mean?	1
2	I have heard men and some women  call her ugly.	How many people have you heard call her ugly?  She is professionally beautiful and the vast majority of people consider her attractive.  Are you hanging out with unusual people?  Are you unaware of the opinions of normal people?	1
2	Feminism is about equality if the sexes, so if you believe in that then I’m very happy to be the one to tell you, your a big fat feminist.	No, I’m not a feminist, I’m an egalitarian. Feminism doesn’t have a monopoly on equality.	0
2	He is being politically correct. If he says he is anti feminist he will be cancelled	So you think he's lying?	0
2	Why would I entertain a misandristic oinky? And thanks for the last part of your comment! I'm completely feminine and super glad it shows❤ Poor desperate way of being sexist against men tho	I have no idea why you accuse me of being misandrist or why you entertain me, but you sure do. And don’t we all have some feminine side?	1
2	If you knew the risk, then why cry? Take accountability and move on. Why hate men for you choices?	Because I still lost a baby? Why are you crying about women getting abortions	1
2	\&gt;Women are solipsistic creatures incapable of self introspection   There is no evidence for this ridiculous universal statement. Next time, try not spoiling a so-so point by following it up with such an obvious pile of shit.	Nothing you said had any validity. It was just a bunch of ad hominen.	1
2	&gt;Guarantee it's because the girl made up a story to save her pride.  Is this common with stupid women? It seems to be thing even in school.	Its a common thing. Men and women do it. The dumb shit you thought ended in school only continues through life but with real consequences.	0
2	To be fair, women don't start a lot of wars. Who cares about "media" as well. Fuck the media.	To be fair 99% of men don't start wars	1
2	In their logic, if you ever claim the men are victim, then its victim blaming, victim could only be women.	Maybe extremists, yeah, but normal feminists would disagree	1
2	Is it really a stereotype if it’s true for almost everyone? If so, the statement “men have penises” would be a stereotype too.	Men having penises is a biological fact  All men harassing women is a stereotype	1
2	As long as it remains a fantasy and any actions taken are provably consensual; mind your own business. You don't get to define what is and isn't acceptable outside of yourself. Way to be the MRA version of a toxic feminist supremacist.	You say "any actions taken are probably consensual"  So as per your logic, if a woman allows a man to cut her breasts off, that should be okay because it was consensual? Please don't tell me you are that full of shit	1
2	He is a real piece of shit. While I do not support the modern feminist agenda, this guy is hardly an improvement. People like him don't want true gender equality. He just wants to force back the old gender roles and probably make life worse for everybody.	Whats wrong with traditional gender roles?	1
2	Really cause you’re trauma making you hate an entire gender isnt “trauma” it’s toxicity and an excuse to hate men	and you know this how? being scared or not trusting of men isn't an abnormal respose to a traumatic experience. Sounds like you're the one making excuses to try blame these victims.	1
2	No wonder men are such pussies around other men! 💡	homosocials	0
2	You do understand, just how hateful and offensive that caricature of men, you just made, is, right?	What exactly do you take issue with?	0
2	I'm a straight woman and I supported feminism back until around the 2010s, it's devolved into a toxic movement that harms both women and men.	If you’re a straight women then how come in some of your comments you claim to be a bi male. Stop spreading your hate you piece of shit bigot	0
2	There is no “feminist” society, there is only a fair society.   In a fair society, women will be held accountable to the same degree as men and vice versa. Its not a hard concept that needs to be explained.	Do you believe men are held accountable or not?	1
2	Well there’s gotta be a reason it’s a wayyy more established thing right? There hasn’t been anybody stopping women doing the same, and yet there are only 28k results for wgtow.	bc it's not established as a group it means women dont do it? How do you know all women who want to be single identify with that specific group? And is the only proof of a negative relationship experience that you give up on dating?	1
2	Then feminism justify their nonsense by saying :"Yeah but vagina mutilation hurts more.."   Like if you could compare such pain...	It is worse.  So what? Its still bad. Something being worse does not make it OK. Genocide is worse than both.	1
2	It's literally a copy/ paste from feminist retorts	Doesn’t make it any less sad. Do better 💀	1
2	If men got crippling cramps every month, they would never shut up about it	I know men who have crippling cramps every day from terminal illness and honestly they sometimes avoid doing the exercises that would make them not as bad.  In other words, shut the fuck up.	1
2	&gt;You guys are generalising a while gender based on the actions of a few people.  Feminism isnt a Gender. The Sub is called "Anti Feminists" not "Anti Women". Get that distinction right.	Yes I know. But there are still some people on here not just attacking feminism but women I general.	0
2	Should we start the same hashtags that women made about us but in reverse 😁	Don't.  We are better than feminists don't forget about it.  We have the moral high ground.	0
2	Can you stop pretending like women raping men is a widespread issue because it literally isn’t. Not to mention that it’s still men who are perpetuating rape myths against male victims (see: prison rape jokes)	You’re talking out of your ass again	1
2	I never said that they were wrongs done to women *specifically*, just the wrongs done to women.	Such language is exactly why I oppose your points. You are a feminist aren't you? Because that sounds like the term feminist...taking human problems and making them about...gestational units.	0
2	This isn’t rape.   1#You could have easily cracked your knuckles across her face and stopped it. Therefore, not rape.  2#wtf no. Just because she is being a bitch doesn’t mean you’re being raped.	You are grim pal	0
2	All women are feminists. Feminism is female nature.  This is why women will never be equal	Feminist leaders from the end of the 19th century said equality with men was not enough.	0
2	I wouldn't say all feminists are stupid. You don't gain power by being stupid.	I don’t think stupid is the right word so much as self righteous with a decent degree of narcissistic tendencies. Outrage is easier to produce than factual evidence.	0
2	Oh I know, and I love the sub for it. It’s just that sometimes I see posts that seem to target women instead of feminism recently( especially with titles like what OP made)and I worry that the shift will get bigger despite the mods’ warnings.	Disliking women is not the same as disliking their behaviours.	0
2	Oh absolutely and I agree. But to be labelled as anti-feminist takes away any weight we have and gives us the reputation of a hate group. That effectively makes people hate us and deflates any of our arguments which is a problem.	Yeah, I agree. Many people see us as hate group, some of them see us as hate group because we are against feminism and many people who are modern feminists see us as a hate group because they think of men's equality as enemies.	0
2	&gt;Or acknowledging science and the fact that biological men can never become pregnant.  Biological men are not the only kind of men.     Biological women are not the only kind of women.	If this is true why use terms man and woman? It's because men and women are different and objectively have different ability and functions.  There is not a single man who can get pregnant. It's not transphobic to acknowledge this.	0
2	I think that its not internalized misandry. But I also think that a lot of times it isn't internalized misogyny either whenever feminists claim it is.   A lot of it is instinctual I think.	Xenophobia is instinctual too, but it is still xenophobia and it isn't tolerated	1
2	If the mens rights movement really wants equality for both sexes, how is shaming women and feminists getting us there	Feminism is a political ideology and, as such, is perfectly entitled to analysis and criticism. If you think feminism should be immune from critique it's become a religion for you.	0
2	yes. I would advocate for my boys doing the same if the women put up the same hard work. Its not sexist.   Its based on a matter of merit	So women don't work hard and have no merits? And this is not sexists?	1
2	You have clearly demonstrated that your singular interest in men's rights is constantly talking about women.  Wanting to talk about women in a MENS RIGHTS group?   What a joke.	Part of standing against misandry is standing against female privilege, but you don't want to shut that down. You love your little goddesses, women-worshipper.	0
2	London already sounds like feminist Robespierre.  "Citizen, you are accused of looking at a woman!"  I wonder when the reign of terror will end.	Lol, this comment is so ignorant.   If you were around for the horrors of the reign of terror, you would not make that comparison so lightly.   How many people have been killed by feminists in Britain? Exactly.	1
2	As a feminist, I would never clap for that shit. It shows extreme ignorance of domestic abuse. As if you can just walk away while they are hitting you.	What makes you a feminist?	0
2	It’s weird to me how society shames the normal dynamic of older guy and younger girl. Women have preferred older men since the dawn of humanity.	It still has concerning and gross origins. The only reason why humanity or society has ever progressed is when it becomes the consensus to reject the things that have existed since the dawn of man. Just because it’s old doesn’t mean it’s good.	0
2	On an issue as dumb as can a man sexually assaulted a women then yes. I think you should stop digging yourself a bigger dumber hole.	So gay men sexually assault women, whom they are not sexually attracted to because…. If a straight guy said that, I somehow think you’d declare him to be a homophobe.	1
2	I’ve seen my best friend naked a bunch of times we even showered and took baths together. FYI Nothing sexual happened!	unless you're bi or gay, can I ask why?	0
2	When will they get over that strawman argument? Anti feminism doesn’t mean anti women’s rights. Feminism doesn’t have a monopoly on equality.	It does though... Femenism is equallity so when you are an antifeminist you are against the equallity of men and women	0
2	Actually that’s a common misconception. Most men don’t eat their ladies’ poop.	Women dont poop anyway, dont be silly	0
2	Where’s the rationality of insulting someone for saying ‘prayers out’ when they were just being nice?	Truth is insulting?	0
2	Men did create the problems…those problems effect both men and women, so fixing this will only help everyone	“Men did create problems” because women are angels?	1
2	I am a woman, and yes, my life is noticeably much easier than my male friends' lives	do people really believe youre a women?	0
2	Women are always raped en masse in every wars we've had before. Nothing new here and that 19 year old girl is going to go through her own war for the rest of her life. Fuck these rapists. Just cut their penises off and be done with it.	Exactly. Both sides use mass rape of the enemy's female population to demoralize the other side. Women are just pawns, collateral damage. No country, no religion, no revolution, no war has ever been truly righteous.	0
2	I don't see the point of this post. Catcalling is wrong. You don't need to be a feminist to know that.	Expressing attraction in somebody should be wrong.	0
2	Why would GTA be haram lol.	because there are some inappropriate women lol	0
2	Biology 101.  i got nothing against trans people but ignoring the biological facts of the matter is regressive.  there are biological difference between male and female and we cannot change because of how we are feeling.	You will NEVER meet a trans person who claims to be biologically their gender, NEVER, it doesn’t happen	1
2	Feminism is about giving "females" more power. It's in the name.	No. You’re very wrong	1
2	Super objective. Judge all men based on some sick f*** who made the papers.	I sometimes can’t believe people like you exist. Really.	0
2	Christianity is rooted in historical facts of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This makes Jesus Christ the authority on all matters. I hope this helps.	The resurrection is not considered a historical fact.	0
2	Men dont fuck women is sexist now.	So gay men were always sexist?	1
2	&gt;why people don’t eat meat or animal products. But they have a lot of hate for it  This guy hasnt been called murderer by vegans for no reason.. just disagree with them one time on something ans see for yourself	I wouldn’t say for no reason. I’m not saying eating meat is immoral. But I think we both understand how you have to kill something in order to eat it.  It’s not that incorrect of a statement. It’s just uncomfortable	0
2	The hypocrisy of society. Mass consumption of sexual content, yet judging the women producing that content.	Men can't deal with shame - it makes them rageful.  Hence, why they constantly push all the shame that belongs to them, onto women.  They are also angry at women for ''making them ''need'' or desire s\*x from them.	0
2	It’s dehumanizing regardless of gender. Everyone knows the porn industry is the marketing department of sex trafficking first of all. Second of all it’s beyond disgusting and there’s no way to prove it’s consensual.	I’m pretty sure most women also watch porn, you’re delusional	0
2	Fear whomever you wish.  However most of the criminals in society are men.	Is anyone arguing that they aren't? No. Does this mean that all men are complicit? Also no.  We should also fear those trying to normalize hate speech, which includes those advocating fearing nearly half the population based solely on gender.	1
2	The good old TERF ideas. Transmen are gender traitors and transwomen are men trying to appropriate for themselves the privileges reserved to women.	Yep.  Whether transgender people should be allowed the privileges of women or not is only an issue because women have privileges.	0
2	And it’s not the same for men eagle forum?	If you are incredibly reductionist about it, you could say a female draft insults their ability to give birth.  Which is, of course, supposed to be seen as anachronistic as fuck. But isn't in this case, unfortunately.	0
2	I thought it was about men acting against their own best interests and health?	The way men treat women is an important part of modern masculinity and when that manifests in self destructive ways it ends up hurting women	0
2	Erm. First of all, most of the sad saps here probably have no idea what empathy or sympathy is.  Secondly, lumping all feminists as those annoying or insane SJWs kinda shows your own shitty incel-ness?	Do you realize you make yourself look dumb?	1
2	no it’s more than not okay. it would get him arrested for sexual harassment	Basically, sexual harassment is attributed ONLY to women, which is not right, sexual harassment to men is not taken seriously, although it is still there, but it is considered the norm or something.	0
2	I believe in true feminism/gender equality, not this misandrist narrative that all men are bad while women aren’t capable of doing bad things.	The one true feminism has never existed and is a mythical selling point to suck people in so they can be radicalized.	0
2	Intersectional feminists are the most hypocritical and hate-fuelled of them all. Ugh.	Intersectional feminists support falsely accused men constantly. Black men are more likely to be falsely accused of rape, hence intersectionality.	0
2	In a post with a contemporary example of male disposability, you're saying male disposability does not exist?	You are confusing male hostility with disposability. society can't function without a strong population of men. So we aren't disposable. Society willing to lose valuable citizens due to their sex is male hostility. This is how you frame it accurately	1
2	Say that to a man who has been forced to pay child support for 18 years	So Im a bit confused.   Do you think its bad that men can be babytrapped against their will?   If you think so SURELY you dont think its good if women are babytrapped against their will either right?	1
2	I believe the world you're looking for is egalitarianism. Such a shame to see that you've been brainwashed by feminist propaganda	I’m not brainwashed. I support equal rights for men and women. Thus, I am a feminist. You’re doing some mental gymnastics here.	1
2	Women are not systematically oppressed, yes. But nothing wrong with advocating for women's rights. Just like there's nothing wrong with advocating for men's rights.	Feminism is not "women's rights". Women have vastly superior rights (laws, policies, and their practical applications).	0
2	Feminism wont do any them favour... but the sad part is they are hurting those who are raising the voice to bring out injustice faced by men	And i completly disagree with male sexuality being demonized by men mostly thats the complete opposite.	0
2	This dad sounds sexist, not necessarily misogynistic. Misogyny isn't just prejudice, it's actual hatred or contempt for women. If he thinks women can't shoot guns, that is sexist. If he thinks women are spiteful and evil, that is misogyny.	Misogyny is a form of sexism.	1
2	Not gonna lie I would have beaten any woman if she hit me, my pet, or tried to destroy my property, but not because of my desire to hit women, because I would have done that even when the person was a man.	Would you behave differently towards a man of similar stature to yourself who hit you versus a much smaller man, half your weight? Or would you simply laugh at the pipsqueak and walk away?	0
2	I've been booted from most of the so called feminist subreddits. Full of libfems who pander to men.	Almost all feminist spaces on here are modded by men.	0
2	Men have their bodies regulated in more ways than women, and when we ask for help with that ... we get responses like you are giving in this thread.	😂😂😂😂😂 you are either joking or on drugs right	1
2	It doesn't contradict it supports it. Why would Abu bakr tell them to stop if he never got told it was haram	That’s not the part of it that contradicts	0
2	I have the feeling it's certain cultural perception and corrupt government policy in some Islamic majority countries that drives people away.	I think it's putting up values like human rights and freedom above religion is what drives people away and what you mentioned too	0
2	You know what else saves water? Women not having to wash the blood out of their pants due to lack of public use sanitary products.	You should look up false dichotomy arguments.  They are very unbecoming.	0
2	You didn’t put anyone down, you just proved you’re an idiot. And feminism doesn’t do anything to improve the lives of women except making them out to be victims	Feminism literally fights for safe access to women’s healthcare cause dicklets like yourself think all life is precious even though all you all do on here is bitch and moan about how life isn’t worth living cause no one will fuck you.	1
2	This conversation is not about gender.	If you're talking about gender you're talking about a social construct. If you don't want to talk about social constructs then you can't talk about gender.	0
2	My point couldn't be more clear. You're wrong. Muslim extremists were around long before the US existed.	So were christian extremists (The Crusades, The Inquisition)	1
2	But not for people accused of rape I take it?	Of course people accused of rape. Only a psychopath would want to lock people up without evidence.	0
2	Sensible, logical women in *your* opinion.	And BOOM you just became illogical and  in no way sensible.	1
2	What a great man! On a side note: We really have to ditch the term "positive“ masculinity though. This is *masculinity*.	What do you call a women who did something like this?	0
2	Feminists are the most misogynistic people I have ever met	True, but they have more misandry than misogyny	0
2	A lot of that is men being deprived.  That doesn't make you privileged. (Some of it: "receiving disproportionately more funding for health issues that primarily affect your gender") does**you** privileged. (Some of it: "	But we have a lot of data for evidence that women are privileged sex. Women are gender aristocracy.	0
2	So saying “Everyday is Men’s day” is bad but saying “Everyday is women’s day” I good?	1) It happens to be true. 2) It's clearly a mockery of feminists, which is fantastic. No war has ever been won by taking the moral high ground so stop showing misandrists a level of civility that they would never show you.	0
2	While I understand that this isn’t the sadness of men dying, women still have to live without their dead husbands. Not saying just women suffer in war, both genders suffer equally in my opinion.	Both genders suffer. But definitely not equally.	0
2	Your paragraph had nothing to do with feminism	It had to do with defending peoples rights to be who they want, if it doesnt harm people.	0
2	My issue with her statement was that she added the   &gt;"Gee, I wonder why".  Which basically implies her brother is a homophobe. That's what caused the drama.  She should have waited 1 day, to call her brother out.	If you don't want your wedding day marred by the consequences of being a homophobe don't be a homophobe.	1
2	So trans women are women with gender dysphoria is what you're saying?	trans women are men with gender dysphoria   trans men are women with gender dysphoria	0
2	Cite your sources.  Men are the most common victims of public sphere violence.	isn't it because men themselves are the ones committing violence?	1
2	Are you fucking stupid? The men’s rights movement- if you can even call it a movement, It’s a pathetic excuse to continue toxic masculinity, isn’t about equality. It’s about keeping men in power	The same can be said about feminism. You are against equality, just accept it and move on. You have to insult people for not thinking like you, you need to grow up and get over yourself.	0
2	Because society only enforces it on men, while giving a free-run to women.	Men don't see the pressures women are under. As I imagine women don't see men's. You cannot blanket say that no women are affected.	1
2	The hair isn’t ʿawrah, the head is.	Where did you get that? The hair IS awrah. If what you said is true, women can cover her head and still show her hair strands which is haram.	0
2	why are you gay? (c)  P.S. I really hope people get it	Who is gay?	0
2	Why do we need to debunk rape statistics?	Because most of them are inflated and entirely discount men as victims of women, or women as perpetrators at all.	0
2	Why would anyone support Amy Schumer. She's so unfunny she started the stereotype of women not being funny	Women were never funny.	0
2	Right, which gives husbands more rights. Women in unhappy marriages can’t leave when they don’t have any property.	Your use of present tense for a historical situation is confusing to me.	1
2	Still a feminist. I don’t see all forms of feminism as antagonic to all forms of men’s rights.	I can appreciate a feminist in their ideas of deconstructing gender and gender roles  But they get it wrong when they don't apply that same energy to the male gender role	0
2	Whine on, fatty. Quit the McNuggets and do some sit-ups- you’ll get there too.   The fact that feminists are (mostly) humorless isn’t a reason to mirror their behavior	I’m actually quite slender, so jokes on you.   And I don’t tolerate hypocrisy of any variety.	0
2	Woman and Female are interchangeable terms.	Just because you say it doesn't make it true.	1
2	They’re rights. I understand people who believe abortion is murder don’t think women should have the right to abort.	Abortion isn’t a right, it’s the opposite, it’s a violation of rights	0
2	No.  It’s ok to tell kids that there are people who believe there are only 2 genders.  And there are people who believe there are lots of them.  It’s not ok to teach kids that one of those theories is correct while one is incorrect.	Actual science disagrees with you.	1
2	NO, but it's not sexual	Kissing isn't sexual?	0
2	If you can denounce the entire group of people purely based on a single Factor of their existence (e.i. their sexuality) the logically the same could hold true for any number of factors, including gender	Yeah but what does that have to do with rape	0
2	That people are born trans.	How people are born has nothing to do with the conversation because gender is a social trait, not a biological one.	1
2	thats your opinion. for others they enjoy traditional living and want the choice to do it. feminism discourages that quite often directly.	I didn’t say they can’t, but being an anti feminist woman doesn’t mean you have to	0
2	Overpopulation. Bad economy. Environmental collapse. Resources becoming scarce. No reason to encourage birthing a kid these days. And again it doesnt make any sense for the father to have any aybin what the women does, Im all for mens rights but common.	There are entire countries committing demographic suicide.  China is finally calling for fecundity.  Europe and Japan could collapse.  Your Malthusian nonsense has been disproved time and again.	0
2	Could be a Married with Children reference too.	Don't try to understand women. Women understand women, and they don't like each other. - Al Bundy	0
2	There is literally nothing in modern society that inherently disadvantages women.  You are relentlessly pandered to nearly at all times and still hate the damn world.	Saying that as a man means nothing. If you don’t think women have modern day struggles it’s because you are willingly obvious to them.	1
2	And yet men are seen as the violent ones	Humans in general are more violent than I would like.	1
2	Standard English means not using an adjective as a noun. Female is an adjective. It does not replace woman.	Female can be both a noun and an adjective. Words can be more than one kind, you know.	0
2	You think that's bad? Read [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/fourthwavewomen/comments/uh8egf/we_need_to_ban_abortion_for_men_please_read_and/) they literally want to enforce men to either undergo surgery or remain a child (no adult rights) no words..	For me, 4th wave feminists and incels are one and the same. Imagine being so immature you villifie half of the population because of their sex.	0
2	I don’t hate or respect women. There are women that I hate, and those I respect. The fact that they are women is irrelevant.  When I comes to relationships, I have a preference for women that weren’t raised to think I’m her oppressor.	If it's irrelevant then why would you assume that women don't hate men? Why one but not the other?	0
2	I mean he isn't exactly wrong, the whole fatphobia/haes equate their struggles with dealing with homophobia and racism. They talk about health at every size while being unable to standup unaided.	They don’t though. Fatphobia isn’t talking about obese people. It’s about not treating fat people like shit just for being fat. It is just about on the same level as homophobia, society treats fat people like garbage.	1
2	No wonder men are such pussies around other men! 💡	Yo wtf kind of gendered insult is this? Why would you use this language? It’s anti-woman.	1
2	Sex workers banfucking scrum and should be treated as suck.  Source~ was raped by one when I was 14	The number of rapes in any country go down considerably when prostitution is legal.  Not saying your words are not valid but prostitution reduces rape on the average.	1
2	So,  be celebate or gay?	You don't think there's crazy gay guys?	0
2	As a catholic there are some things I’m not to sure about. Even if Islam came as a 101% right religion with a one percent error margin I would never ever convert .	So you agree that there is a path to salvation and that the catholic faith has flaws and yet even if Islam is 101% the only path to salvation, you would not follow it?  You don’t believe in the afterlife and the day of reckoning?	0
2	Hahahahha say this a few more times to yourself and let me know when you realize how ridiculous of a statement this is	Why is that ridiculous?	0

2	Those religious people disagree with gay marriage, and don't want to conduct the ceremonies. They are not being bigoted imo.	Do you not think it possible for traditions or religions to be steeped in bigotry? And if they can be, are the people who adhere to them not also bigots?	0

2	I think that’s your porn addiction talking 🤷🏻‍♂️	How does my addiction reason with the fact that someone else shows a body part in an ugly way, huh what fucking arguement is this?	0
2	“Many people are born different and feel more comfortable with their own sex”	Sounds like you're talking about sexuality, that's illegal.	0
2	Oh, they are. They just don't openly use religion to justify it	Yea according to many people religion is made up.  So they use made up stories instead of real people, like minorities	0
2	I mean the last messenger sent by god is prophet Mohammad and anyone receiving his message rightly and purely and denies it, is defying god, and in that case what will his worship be of any use ?	So you're basically saying other religions' beliefs are false ? Only Islam is correct ?	1
2	Regardless of religious beliefs or not "Trans" isn't a real thing. It's a made up feeling. You're really only straight, gay, or bi.  Had a bi friend that insisted he was a gay guy that liked girls.	Being transgender has nothing to do with one’s sexual orientation. ￼ It’s about a person’s gender identity.	1
2	That thing is extremely rare but it’s surprising to see it even a thing. It’s literally homicide.  Anyone know the origin on how honor killings appeared in the modern Muslim world?	It’s really not as rare as you think. It’s not always killing, but the idea of honoring your family or yourself by harming others is not that uncommon. It’s really awful though.	0
2	Homophobia is not men's rights	What does that mean?  What is homophobia in this context?  Be specific.	0
2	You don’t think Kamala Harris is qualified?	You’re joking right	0
2	Okay, so it seems like you have been successful at dating.	Yes, I have. But that doesn't have much to do with whether the bar for dating is low or not. I definitely don't think it's particularly low and so far you've yet to explain why you think it is.	0
2	So these women are closet lesbians? An interesting hypothesis, at least.	According to entertainment, all women are at least bisexual.	0
2	Wow homophobia, great look.	Gay men literally do not have to worry ab women’s reproductive rights. You’re the homophobe if you are offended by that statement	0
2	But at the same time minority races experience forms of systemic racism that trans people don’t.	yeah, trans people experience systemic transphobia instead	1
2	Yep, the libs sure have made this place worse.	You do realise their opponents are even more favour of this stuff?  I’m afraid it’s the zeitgeist.  Amongst the political class and the elites anyway.	0
2	At the same time, he is trying to imply that LGBTQ2S+ are more promiscuous which is a dangerous stereotype.	But gay men are more promiscuous which studies have shown. Why is it ‘dangerous’ to assume that?	0
2	It really is game over for all types of romantic relationships unless you're pretty braindead.	Romantic attitude to relationships is very naive delusion of men.	0
2	I’m a hetero guy and I’d be insecure and uncomfortable changing in a room full of women. When someone could be interested in you physically it can change how you feel around them, straight or gay.	Are you comfortable changing in a room full of men? Some of them may be gay you know?  What about a room full of lesbians? Can you not see the difference?	0
2	I mean yeah... Lesbian couples are more abusive than gay and heterosexual couples. Shows that even women can be violent	Women are more abusive in any kind of relationship	0
2	No. School is for teaching my child how to read, write, do math, lessons about history, geography, etc. Its not for my 5 year old to learn about sexuality. That’s my job to decide if and when that’s appropriate.	No. You are wrong I'm afraid. You don't have to like it, but that's just tough. Gay people exist in society, acknowledging that simple fact isn't teaching your kids about sexuality any more than acknowledging that straight people exist.	1
2	Looks like an attack on some religious minorities. Don't want to sound like crazy leftists, but mra movement definitely has a nazi problem.	Also, religious minorities? It’s a set of the largest religions in the world.	0
2	What a wildly rude and dehumanizing thing to say to others.  You don’t get to tell people their sexual orientation isn’t legitimate.  It’s 2022.	Grow up	0
2	It’s more concerning that you need a law to tell you not to fuck kids. Concerning…	Almost as concerning as people pissing themselves trying to make sure their right to fuck children is constitutionally protected	0
2	Yes I have Imgur, but no I'm not going to allow you to waste my time, so I'll reply when I can be bothered with you, sweet cheeks	Yeah yeah you’re just upset you can’t argue correctly	0
2	Oh shit what about atheists	its haram(impermissible) to marry them for both muslim men and muslim women.	0
2	&gt;why people don’t eat meat or animal products. But they have a lot of hate for it  This guy hasnt been called murderer by vegans for no reason.. just disagree with them one time on something ans see for yourself	Jesus … where do you all live	0
2	Hmm, I think combined with my second statement its pretty clear what I mean though.  What a good intention is, is defined by Islam. A good intention can never be based on things which are haram. So, islamically, that statement of yours is not true.	So hiding your true nature out of respect for your mother is not haram ?	0
2	Yes. Christianity should be the only legal religion. All other religions should be banned.	Arguably the WORST part of Christianity is the concept that Christian beliefs are the only correct ones and everyone else is wrong.	1
2	&gt; WTF?  The only "WTF" here is that you are literally defending monogamy, as though anyone is sexually attracted to just a single, aging person for life.   Like I said, the institution is irrational.	Just because you're a slut doesn't mean we all are.  The concept of finding a person that fits you best and sticking with them and making something special together is far more appealing than just fuck and forget.	0
2	Love is fine, if you think it's the only thing that should be considered when marrying then you're being a bit shortsighted.	Seems like most men feel the same and most women disagree	0
2	Get over yourself	What do you mean?	0
2	Rapists don’t use condoms.	Tell us that you want the other 99.99x % of abortions banned or don’t waste our time whining about rape when you don’t really care about it and you’re just trying to be emotionally manipulative.  It’s one of the other.  Which is it?	0
2	The show? Not really halal but not horribly haram, either, I think.	Haram is haram sin is a sin and I think it has women without covering and wait I think people there risking their lives that show will just make ur heart cold and make u insensitive don't watch it please	0
2	Your attempt to draw an equivalency between a historically repressed and brutalised minority and white Christians is piss-poor.	So white working class, working poor, and poor people have nothing to be enraged about.	1
2	She protects pedos. Tf why wouldn’t she protect nazis. 🤢	No she doesn't and those two things aren't related. You jumped to a conclusion but interestingly also managed to jump to a hypothesis.	0

2	One month, yet he hasn't answered you but he still continues to claim on other threads what the salaf supposedly believe in or what their positions are but never substantiating his claims with evidences.	I just dont get it	0
2	Nothing. That's the point.  Gender has two parts. Gender roles and stereotypes. We covered that part. Then there is gender identity which means how individual see themselves related to these gender roles.  Sex has nothing to do with gender.	How individual see themselves related to the gender roles? To my knowledge gender identification is not about that. If just based how one feels, which is arbitrary in general.	0
2	Oh just shut the fuck up. I’m gay and 80% of my friends are gay.	Just because you're gay doesn't give u to right to be bigoted against gay people	1
2	No, we have not encouraged cheating on your partner anyone who does that is shitty	I personally know Feminists who do encourage it.	0
2	Why are you using a picture of this man? Do not give any credibility to a person who is not a good influence to any human, let alone Muslims.	Dude, it’s literally just a joke, chill.	0
2	Should I also call white supremacists strong independent men?	How does being a racist white person compare to someone not having sex with women?	1
2	That’s what my post is, they’re dependent on each other, I don’t believe in gender, thus the idea of transgender people doesn’t make sense.	Not really, you keep saying gender doesn't matter, but you also only say transpeople should be minimised. As a result you come across as a bigot.	0
2	love is like a fart. If you force it, it's probably shit	It makes everyone around you gag.	0
2	Gender /= sex	Words have to have definitions though	0
2	I wish I was born gay I really do I'm tired of this shit	You don't have be gay.   You can live a single, forever bachelor life.    (Hetero/homo)Sexuality isn't a choice, but getting into a relationship is certainly a choice.	1
2	I absolutely hate the idea that men are just edgy homophobic racist people, and women are the good ones.  From my experience, I have never seen any men objectify and fetishise lesbians, but I have seen plenty of women fetishise and objectify gay men.	I don't know how people seem to blame only white men when it comes to racism. Racism is  taught to children and the people who raise children are usually women, why doesn't that come up.	0
2	Im not a man or a women. Im non-binary	Hate to break it to you, but there are exactly two genders. You are either a man or a woman.	0
2	That’s the point. Splitting expenses evenly with someone who makes more than you is fiscally stupid.	You say "someone" who makes more than you but fail to concede that this isn't always the case. So which is it? You're basing your decision on what all men make as a group, not that one person.	1
2	It's not. Many people have come out as gay despite being vehemently against originally...	You guys don't like the truth eh? There's lots of examples...	0
2	[a link to their actual website](https://www.abrahamichouse.org) [an explanation of the building of the project itself ](https://www.khaleejtimes.com/uae/uae-abrahamic-family-house-names-of-mosque-church-synagogue-announced?amp=1)	Doesn't seem like a religion, but a sort of interfaith programme.	0
2	everyones elbows are touching the ground and the girl doesnt have a proper head covering on, the only scene in a mosque and they already missed it up.	What do ya think about people who are practising religion from far away will do. Of course this is not a faithful representation. Also America has women imams and stuff. That’s what American people see and perceive , it’s not completely there fault	0
2	If someone believes they didn’t consent, then they didn’t consent. It doesn’t matter if you believe you have consent if you don’t have it.	Not true at all. The legal threshold for rape is not “the victim believes they didn’t consent”.  That holds just as much legal weight as “alleged rapist believes consent was given.”	0
2	well most muslims i have talked to online have told me that this is the rule, so i'm trying to understand if it's a small minority who believe that or if it's most people	The ruling undeniably exists, but muslims sin just like any other religious people. There are muslims who drink, eat pork, speak callously, steal, dress skimpily, etc. That doesn't mean those things are not prohibited.	0
2	“I would give public schools the opportunity to teach kids about the equality of different forms of relationships”. We’re talking about public schools now. How do public schools outwardly teach about heterosexuality?	I dont know if they do. But the fact that there are many schools that can teach heterosexual supremacy but no schools that can teach homosexual equality is where the discrimination lies in society. And why don't say  gay perpetuates discrimination	1
2	When you boil it down, they aren’t. They don’t have complete sovereignty over themselves and can not voluntarily leave the US as in say the EU	States rights?   We have our own governments , laws, and constitution. I'm done. You are refusing to see the abstraction of reality.	0

2	More about gender roles or divine sex like it strangly may indicate that man and woman when married form one singular genderless soul and one physical being. "Inside" and "outside"	This is the hermeneutic, biblical literalism, gone wrong. Its about us not having earthly desires or relationships(as there is no marriage etc in heaven) not undergoing sex changes or dispensing with biblical roles.	0
2	What if the filmmakers were gay?	What's ironic is gay men actually dislike women, some even hate.	0
2	I think a person would be a creepy harmful person for doing that. Regardless of gender.	I mean no. No one should be considered like that. The only thing the person can be considered is stupid or rude (because who expects a reply from a person who is jogging and could run out of breath if speaks).	0
2	Found the homophobe	Mate I have family people who are close enough to me who may as well be family and other friends who are part of the LGBTQ who I love dearly to call me a homophobe is ABSOLUTELY RETARDED and an insult	0

2	No, the situations are nothing alike.  The State of Israel didn't exist 100 years ago, but Palestine has always been Jewish land.	And America has always been native land. Should the indigenous start murdering US citizens?	0
2	Oh you didn't get the message? No one gives a shxt about exposing kids to sexual imagery anymore. Apparently none of us are meant to care because we're all so free and liberal these days.	Do you use the word liberal to insult everything you dislike? Genuinely	1
2	And that cannot include a trans woman? That's an adult female human being	‘Female’ is defined in terms of physical sexual characteristics and reproductive organs though	0
2	People’s genders and sexuality.  Shouldn’t be a big deal and shouldn’t be a concern for everyone	the reason people are so loud about it is because it's discriminated against and hard to live a normal life--I'm sure lots of people being loud about it would agree it shouldn't be a concern.	0
2	Anyone who thinks prostitution should be legalized is a degenerate. I find it even grosser when people who claim to be Christians are pro sex work.	So, you have a problem with marriages where the woman just stays home?	1

2	Im not a Quranist im just Muslim. What are some peoples fascination with being called everything but Muslim??	Well, i think is the same with any religion or even political ideology. Things just aren't simple sometimes.	0
2	Im saying people who think the refferal to jews is only linked to religous beliefs, are stupid.	And that’s stupid. The religious beliefs are intrinsically linked to the ethnicity and even “non-practicing” Jews observe tons of Jewish religious customs.	1
2	It's the UK. You can be arrested for merely pointing out the fact most of the public stabbings are caused by "refugee immigrants".	most of the stabbings are black kids stabbing each other, the majority born here	0

2	That’s not accurate at all. Look at the history of of colonialism and British imperialism. Seldom were they the majority population.	White people have been oppressed, colonized, genocided and enslaved by black, brown, muslim and asian people countless times. Your anti-white racist ass needs to learn history.	0
2	And then she gets her Ancestry.com genetic results in the mail. Then takes her kid to get gene therapy, then eats genetically modified corn that resists drought. Wait! All this is covered in the Theory of Evolution! Goddamn Jews!	Evolution is the backbone of all biological sciences, including medicine.	0
2	When you say BIPOC, just say you hate the jews and Asians, we get it	Asian people are people of color. I don't know enough about the ethnicity, culture, and struggles of Jewish people to classify them as people of color, but Asian people definitely are.	0
2	So they prefer to live with their mouths shut, unless its done to their families, so after they flee?	So because a person hasn’t taken arms against their government they are doomed to whatever hell they are born into? My god you’re coming across as an ignorant insensitive prick here	0

2	If you're a Republican, this is what you support.	Not true. It is too simplistic and dangerous to draw conclusions like that.	0
2	While true, our Black, Brown and Asian brother bear even more of the brunt of the abuse.	Not necessarily so. Asians have been known for some time to enjoy a privileged class in western society.

2	There is a massive difference between an actual developed human and a fetus that still doesn't gain anywhere near the level of human consciousness until roughly 18 weeks of development.	Human consciousness is currently unable to be observed by science.

2	im not racist but hate Black people	I'm not racist/sexist but I hate White men	0
2	To be honest, I’d imagine most Ukrainian men fighting would want their families be moved to safety.  But you’re right.	It’s not the point. The point is about unequal application of a law. Feminists are silent because it exposes their movement as fraudulent and riddled in hypocrisy	0
2	I’m not a Russian bot. Im just not low iq like y’all. Y’all are so predictable that it’s getting sad.	None of that even makes sense, you just keep saying we're predictable but why? Lol	0
2	That’s what I’m saying, those translations came from a bunch of white dudes sitting in a room and deciding what it all meant. Frankly I don’t trust any of the translations at this point until I finally can read Hebrew myself	If you don't trust any of the translations, then why did you claim that it refers to pedophilia and not homosexuality? If you don't know Hebrew, then how can you know that?	0
2	Jewish thinking and behaviour, arabs should not fall into the same trap	Jewish thinking? So antisemitism is acceptable now?	1
2	I would think it's because parents should know! Parents are in charge of their kids not teachers or school administrators. I fail to see why anyone would want to interject themselves into something like this.	You don’t want to protect children from insane religious nuts who threaten their kids for simply being who they are?	0
2	Please don't say feminazi,, that's literally saying a feminist is a nazi and that's literally taking away the struggles of Jewish people.	No it's not taking away the struggles of the Jewish people.  Nazis were also about totalitarian control.  The feminists are the same way.  Besides who do you think are the ones who say "kill all men" and laugh about it.	0
2	I've worked with patients with schizophrenia, I've seen this. Their insight into their own illness is terrible. That's why they have to be kept in hospital against their will	I’ve read some people say schizophrenia is more like a brain or neurological disease than mental illness- and that it should be viewed like Alzheimer’s or Parkinson’s. Do you think this is accurate or not really?	0
2	What? Black skin is a physical trait. Black culture is a social aspect.	Dark skin is a physical trait, does having that trait mean someone from south India is black? Does it mean a fairly light skinned black person born to dark skinned parents and growing up in a black community isn’t really black if they’re lacking?	0
2	You can joke about anything but not about someone’s medical illness	Sure. But that’s not what you just said. It’s ok to to poke fun at people.	0
2	Well one is the truth and the other is a mental illness	In all seriousness it's not clear which you think is which. You could easily be either a religious conservative or an atheist who thinks religion is delusion.	0
2	Only mentally ill people laugh at things that aren't funny.	Sure haram police lol	0
2	All they want is a smoke screen to hide the fact they hate her because she's a black woman.	What’s a woman?	0
2	Wanting to eradicate neo-Nazism and white supremacy makes me a Nazi?	Wanting to throw civil liberties to the wind and arrest people who haven’t actually committed any crimes is fascist and authoritarian.	0
2	Being depressed is literally a chemical imbalance in your brain causing you to feel unwarranted sadness/nothingness. People don’t “choose” that.	Depression is just like any other human emotion. You have the ability to control your emotions.	0
2	Speaking as an autistic person *with CPTSD* (who solidly stopped believing in those things at 5), your aRgUmEnT is incredibly ableist towards your son (and the entire autistic community), as well as factually inaccurate.   Check yourself. 🤨	I don't take orders from you.  I speak only for myself and my son. I don't presume to speak for everyone's experience, that's your misconstruction.	0
2	This is the same with all autistic people, not just men. But I do acknowledge that it is an issue	Are you seriously treating this as a “men have autism women most affected” type situation? Having autism sucks for all genders and ages.	0
2	Point is I know disabled people. I never said people with disabled parking tags aren't disabled. I said if they're I'm a lifted truck they aren't disabled enough to need to park closer.	You “know disabled people”? There are thousands of disabilities.	1
2	Hell have the disabled Nazi vote for sure.	“Not all disabilities are physical”	0
2	I’m pretty sure Judaism is a religion, not a race.	It's considered both a Religion and an ethnic group. For example, your can be convert to Judaism and new from any group. Or you can be ethnically Jewish, but not practice the Religion.	1
2	I was just saying the statements get similar criticism, not trying to insult at all.   Both statement to me mean, 'dont forget' to believe women or dont forget black lives matter. I needs to be said bc people forget	In my experience, last few years, people have forgotten "innocent until proven guilty".   Bad faith rhetoric like believe all women are majorly responsible for that.	0
2	Most of the right does have a bigotry problem but its usually not constrained to even race, let alone jews.	I'd say most of people are bigots to some extent. We can help ourselves with simplifications, exaggerations and generalizations.	0
2	&gt; “It’s a nice change” &gt;  &gt; You being for real? This is a constant towards people of color and especially women of color. &gt;  &gt; If anything, the “nice change” WAS the use of “Karen’s”  So u dont like diversity?	Karen isn't a racial slur	0
2	Nothing. At least not if my country is anything to go by. 80% of the population wanted it banned but the Jewish community cried about religious prosecution and got it blocked.	Antisemitism used to make no sense to me.	0
2	Oh so you aren't even Israeli. What are you gonna say next, that you're not Jewish? Also I was not pretending to be american you stupid	Ahaha, on from attacking me and accusing me of being Israeli, onto accusing me of being Jewish?  You really are antisemitic.	1
2	[It came out that she constantly bashes black men and these tears are for the white guys who didn't choose her](https://twitter.com/Tosci_Marie/status/1490436031950299138?t=xkUPdTYc756WsVSQgmeBqg&amp;s=19)	You bash black women so why do you care that she doesn’t like black men?	1
2	Because this is very much socialism.	This doesn’t make any sense at all and you should be ashamed of yourself for saying something so incorrect publicly.	0
2	Its just purely because society has made the term "mental illness" a no-no phrase. Thats why its rarely heard ever lol.	ADHD is different than something like OCD or depression. The distinction between neurological disorder and mental illness is not semantic.	0
2	I mean defending Nazis in Ukraine is the mainstream position now too, actual clown world.	Hahaha! You "think" that's reality. Hilarious	0
2	So if Beyoncé were ugly, she could have as much success since society sees her *just as* ugly as an ugly black woman?	Unattractive black women can still have careers. I don’t think Beyoncé’s success has much to do with her looks. The only people who gas Beyoncé up are other block women.	0
2	Bruh	No one hates real people. They hate characters. Don't play the part and be cool as fuck	0
2	You’re ignoring what I wrote, “black” is not a physical trait, it’s a socially constructed category.	What? Black skin is a physical trait. Black culture is a social aspect.	1
2	YES!!  i can finally fuck a black guy	You say this like that's difficult to achieve.	0
2	Pro tip, if you ever find yourself saying "No I am right," you're probably not right.  The court has had two black justices out of 100. If you think specifically correcting that imbalance is racist, you've just called MLK a racist.	Race has nothing to do with being a court justices there was nothing to correct	0
2	Doesn't this depend entirely on the severity of the illness. There are many degrees, not everyone who has a mental illness has completely abandoned morality.	No it doesn't depend entirely on the severity of the illness. The vast majority (if not all) of people with severe mental illness have not abandoned morality any more than they would have if they did not have any mental illness.	0
2	You don't get to make that decision for adults. If they want to smoke and die then that's their choice. If they want to eat and balloon up to 600lbs abd sure from a heart attack at 40 then that's their choice too.   Stop with your bullshit.	Bullshit? What bullshit? I mean, it'd be nicer if people couldn't hurt themselves so easily, no?	1
2	They are not the same for the same reason as autism and Downes syndrome are not the same. Both things are bad and it shouldn't be "who's more of a victim" competition.	They're literally both genital mutilation. How does the victim''s gender matter ?        Or if you mean rape , they're literally both rape. How does the victim's gender matter ?	1
2	What, that nobody is entitled to respect? If you haven't raised your kid to be at least that resilient, you've utterly failed.	Stop being an asshole dude. It's completely unnecessary.	0
2	IF U LOVE HER, treat her like a queen  and as Messiah loved the church and gave himself for it. EPH 5:21-33  IF U cannot do that U obviously do not love her, let her go.	Feeding into her irrational behaviour isn’t treating her like a queen.  It’s bad for her. It’s bad for you.	0
2	Never going the point of racism we all bleed the same and I know how it feels to be called nxgger and stuff since I’m a black male it hurts your confidence	Yea it’s ridiculous and doesn’t make any sense. It’s all ego	0
2	But It's not the simple experiment is asking black women which is worst but you choose to generalize and speak for all women.the same thing you villianize and call me racist for	You're just lying about what I've said. I NEVER said all women. Not at any point. You're just lying about what I've said now.	0
2	I dont think any parts are made to "scare people". I think they're heavily either taken out of context or the translations are changed. I read both Hebrew and Greek bibles so I can stay away from the bad interpretations and translations.	are you fucking stoned?	0
2	because I'll get arrested in my sovereign socialist ***secular*** republic for *blasphemy*.	What country is that? Blasphemy laws are a fucking outrage.	0
2	😂😂😂  Don't shout your ignorance out like that  Psychiatric nurses are getting attacked all the time, and they manage just fine *without weapons*	Ignorance? I am retired LEO, that worked in a mental health unit in a prison. Go away…	0
2	While your comment is very disagreeable, you might like to know women and African Americans are the fastest growing demographic of gun owners.	Women are generally weaker so it’s only fair. It’d reduce rape. Who’s against less rape?	0
2	Well the original premise is that approaching a 35 year old is "grooming" with the implication that she has no agency or ability to make a choice... the direct "agency"-&gt;"you can fuck her" is a red herring and the logic of retards	You still have power over her, and your relationship is way more likely to be abusive than one between people of similar ages. :)	0
2	able to properly judge a persons mental stability and character	You fall in love with everyone you meet	0
2	Idk bro, cops power trip but they target black men a lot cause of there easier targets	the difference between cops targeting men and women is far bigger than the white vs black comparison. Police brutality is a sexism issue first and foremost.	0
2	We have a serious mental health crisis in this county.	Nothing to do with mental health. This is propaganda. And people who are disadvantaged by the corrupt will believe anything.	0
2	Literally. A Black man held another Black man accountable for misogynoir against his Black wife. I think that’s important to note. Definitely better than sitting there and doing nothing tbh.	Black people are never given the same level of benefit of the doubt that white people are. Especially black woman, anything that isn't appeasement is seen as aggression. It's a very big problem.	0
2	They're cats. They engage in the same range of cat behaviors as others. Some are stealthy. Some are dumb. Some are sweet or submissive. Some won't be pushed around.   I'm not superstitious about black cats.	Doesn't that debunk your own statement? Some people are superstitious of black cat's you are not you are colorblind (when it comes to cats) threating black cat's differently cause some people are superstitious about them would be bonkers	0
2	Things aren’t “rough right now” that’s an absurd reduction of what suffering life on earth is capable of experiencing and it’s usually life long	So because things are rough for you right now, you want to end life for everyone?	0
2	He seems particularly sensitive and should focus more on self improvement over trying to blame others for his problems.	Yeah, go and say that to a woman and see how it goes. You would be called misogynist right away.	0
2	Just ask them "even black men too?".	They’re racist, black men are the worst in their eyes	0
2	Feminists stay silent when men are falsely imprisoned for rape, especially Black men.  Feminism is Racism as well as Sexism.	Funny enough, feminism was a movement started by black women (in America anyway), taken over by white women, and when these feminists got the vote black women were left out... feminism kind of is racist to its core	0
2	We still haven't had a single Asian or indigenous person sit on the court.  Black women may have supported Biden but they're also likely to support any person on Team blue.	Why not a half-Asian-half-Indigenous person on the court if one exists, unless you think instead of representing biracial people too they'll only half-represent each race they're half	0
2	Black people are 2.5x more likely to get shot by the cops, but *aren't* 2.5x more likely to commit crimes  Black people are much more likely to get food stamps, and *are* much more likely to be of low socioeconomic status/poor.	but aren't 2.5x more likely to commit crimes  This is incorrect.  The level of gun violence and other violent crimes is more than 2.5 times higher in black communities.	0
2	It can refer to many different things.  Republicans packed the Supreme Court with political stooges and hacks by lying their way against an established precedent.	No. It has one widely accepted meaning	0
2	Underage drinking is terrible, with a lot of bad personal memories of underage people getting drunk…so yes…yes I would	Well at least you're consistent even if that is a position like 90% of people would disagree with.	0
2	My kid ain’t smart enough to be an engineer.  He’s got ADHD and dyslexia. He’s setting himself up to fail.	ADHD and dyslexia have nothing to do with intelligence. They may present additional challenges, but they don't mean your kid isn't smart. You clearly have a lot of resentment for your child that "back luck" bestowed upon you when you were 16.	1
2	It's unethical, and he would have to convince every single person in the room to corroborate his story, which is risky. Not many nurses, assistants, workers are willing to risk their careers if someone slips up and points fingers.	i mean- its also unethical to refuse a necessary medical procedure so in this case its kind of a lesser of two evils situation	0
2	The numbers are absolutely relevant. Could Shang Chi be a black guy? There are black people in China after all.	Yes he could because you can be black and be Chinese.  You are you trying to argue people who have been born and raised in China for generations aren't Chinese because of their skin color?	1
2	I will cut off this right arm of mine before I will ask for the ballot for the Negro and not for the woman.   \-Susan B. Anthony	Do you believe feminists were more racist on average than your average white shithead back then?	0
2	As a black person I can honestly say no one cares	Plenty of Black people absolutely do care lol	0
2	Nothing to assume or project, if you have unhealthy coping mechanisms, you will mostly never get better? isn’t that a given?	Lol. You're doing it again. Do you really not see how messed up this is?	0
2	They really are not they hang around our black neighbors and everything by rarely I mean very very rare they’re not like for enslaving black people	wow... there's so much space between "wanting to enslave black people" and carrying zero unconcious bias.  everything between is still "racist".	0
2	Never had a felony committed against you and told you lack evidence have you?	You have brought nothing of value to this discussion with your comment.	0
2	?? Cops get away with shooting innocent unarmed black men all the time wth u mean ?? 🤡🤡	and white men, as well. 13 / 52 my friend, you should be more worried about black on black violence because it’s much more prevalent than police on black violence	0
2	Maybe not. Maybe he was on a medication or he has a condition that impairs production or uptake of the DMT. He could have lost consciousness before the DMT/oxygen deprivation stage. He might have gone through all that and just not formed a memory.	There’s a lot of flaws in that belief.	0
2	Just do what you said if a minor was touched they could be traumatized as an adult if an adult who’s 40 years old was touched no	No, you didn't understand. "Minor" does not mean "underaged" in my sentence. It's used to describe the type of sexual assault that you consider to be inconsequential (i.e., nonconsensual kissing, groping, etc.)	0
2	I'm autistic; what's *your* excuse?	What does being autistic have anything to do with this?	1
2	Pretty obvious what I'm on about. If you had a single brain cell, you'd understand.	Silly goose. Just stop talking	1
2	You’re not and understanding person.. at all. It shows. Therapy might help??	Oh, shut up man. You're not helping anything or not pursuing any kind of normal discussion. You're trying to raise hate. Stop that.	1
2	Exactly. They self-diagnose and blame everything on it, but it's not ADHD.	The things you described are not symptoms of ADHD.	0
2	Well, that‘s what‘s happening to many black people rn sadly	Black people are being fined for saying "It's okay to be White."?	0
2	They would still be addressed under a universal approach. And it would also be inclusive of non-black minorities.	That's never once actually been the case and to think this would be any different is foolish.  Not to mention the reality that the challenges that Black Americans have faced are quite unique compared to other minorities in the U.S.	0
2	Never would’ve thought a mood disorder would be set next to blindness. Are all mood disorders considered disabilities?	Yes mood disorders and psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia are considered disabilities if it affects the persons daily living conditions. Not all disabilities are physical and visible.	1
2	There are many examples, teaching is definitely one of them.	Also many examples about male dominated professions, we all just have to suck it up and deal with it	0
2	I suppose we just hoped for the best as all her check ups were proving good and medical advancement has come a long way and such complications are growing less common. We were so focused on the good we didn't want to consider the bad I suppose	Complications are still ridiculously common. Ignoring the possibility doesn’t decrease it.	0
2	Why because she is black ??? Or because she is an abusive woman who failed to control herself. And takes whatever she can from the world.	Black women receive lower sentences and incarcerations then  white men	0
2	Black women	How is that an aspect of culture?	1
2	Democrats made fraud and now they are destroying your economy.. enjoy it.	Fuckin communist	0
2	Nerdy trytard, im a mobile user.	Same here. The only difference is I care enough to pay attention what I’m responding to. You don’t care enough to think at all	0
2	its not crazy or insane, it's called a response to trauma.	Alright so if a white women gets raped by a black man it’s reasonable for her to hate all black people	0
2	So Joe Biden saying “If you don’t vote for me, you ain’t black,” isn’t the No True Scotsman fallacy?  All those words in Biden’s quote have definitions.  However, it’s saying no true black person would vote against him.	No, it definetly is. But if you claim to be a feminist and then all your actions aren't perpetuating equality are you actually a feminist?	0
2	Most gendered violence is inflicted on women.   And black people are disproportionately hurt by the justice system.   Those are facts whether you like them or not.	Black people are more likely to commit crime.   That's like saying "X" race of people are killed most by trains, and that means trains are racist. Well, if "X" race stands in front of trains way more than anyone else.....that's gonna happen. 🤷🏻‍♂️	1
2	Dude, half black and whites are "brown", people aren't racist to them  Its to South asians	No, that's not how that works.   Mixed people are just "mixed," they don't become a different color.	1
2	Except Kentucky is ran by the democrats	You sound intelligent…	0
2	yep they want to make sure old crusty dudes control black people	And also white people, Latinos and Asians	0
